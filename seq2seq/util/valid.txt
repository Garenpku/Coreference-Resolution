I do like chicken on it as well . I even like it plain . I wished I could get pizza delivered to my home , but I live too far out of the county . But , it would be dinner a couple times a week if I could !

Yeah people basically become the characters ! LARPS remind me of reenactments .
I love Classical Music . It helps me relax after a long day . Do you like Classical ? I listen to it on occasion , I just find it rigid and structured unlike jazz or blues , but I do listen on occasion to clear my mind . I can ' t stand Jazz . I need something besides high pitch horns . Classical music tells a story . To each his own for sure ! But jazz is actually called America ' s classical music in some places . I ' m native American and I don ' t consider it classical at all . Give me a drug circle that ' s classical . Well music is an art form and not everyone has the same taste and that is perfectly fine . If we did the world would be a boring place . I guess so . But in the end we only have one true classical music . It ' s the music of deep thought , relaxation and brain power .
Penguin Random House seems like it has been around for awhile . I think it was founded in 2013 , sometime in the summer . I have heard of it prior to that . It was formed in America in 2013 from a merger between Random House , and the Penguin group . Okay that makes sense . I have heard of them separately then . Yeah they may have formed in America , but they employ people from across the globe through publishing , and the digital book trade . Do you know when each of them separately formed ? No , but I do know that Random House was a German Media conglomerate Bertelsmann , and Penguin Group was a British publishing company Pearson PLC . What else do you know about the merger ?

They must have been crazy ! Sherman Poppen ! He was an engineer in Michigan . He invented the toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together . Guess what he called it ? What did he call it ?

I usually just swim by myself doing laps , but I enjoy watching competitions , especially during the summer Olympics . It sounds like you live a great and balanced life . Out of curiousity , why do you do it ... fun , health or family thing ? I used to be on swim team when I was younger and I loved it . Now that I ' m older it ' s a good activity for me since it ' s low impact compared to running which hurts my knees . That is a great reason ! I was just curious , I like to know the background to people I chat with . I bet you burn massive calories in a pool ? I try , some days more than others . It ' s amazing to me how the body is just slightly less dense than water and the water supports of weight of us while we swim .

People seem to either love or hate Donald Trump . He is the 45th president and had been in office since Jan . 20 , 2017 . Do you like him ? I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt when he was elected . Hate is a strong word . I do not support a lot of the decisions he ' s made while in office , though . But maybe you can give me a balanced view . What do you know about him ? He grew up in Queens but then went to Pennsylvania to get an economics degree from Wharton , so he ' s at least well educated . I see . That makes sense . Can you tell me anything specific to his election and / or presidency ? I don ' t know much in depth about his presidency just know some about him . He entered the race as Republican and actually defeated 16 other opponents in the primaries . I had no idea he defeated 16 people in the primaries . I guess that sort of is impressive , and is a testament to how much people wanted him in office . What is something more unique about him that you know ? I find this an interesting fact . He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pagents from 1996 all the way to 2015 . Hah ... probably a first for an elected president . You ' re right , that is interesting . I actually want to hear something else along those lines , as I ' m sure there are many unique things about him that make him stand out as a president , good or bad , because of his colorful history . Most people know that he was the host on The Apprentice but most people are unaware that he the the producer , as well .

Although victims are unable to control their thoughts , cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) helps with developing coping techniques .

Well I will be sure to stick to it and practice thanks !
I really love the patterns formed by wind blown sand upon rocks . I know what you mean , I love being outside in nature in general . I prefer to go to the beach and search for rocks that have been washed with sand to form little pebbles . The beach is great , I don ' t get to go very often . I ' m more of a lake person . I live quite close to the ocean so I am able to find them on a daily basis . Our beach is considered a shingle beach as it has many pebbles . Interesting , the beaches that I ' ve been to have only had fine sand . But there is always algae in the water . I love living next to the sea as it moderates Earth ' s climate and plays a very important roll in the cycle of carbon , nitrogen and water . That ' s why I think we need to be more aware of the health of our ocean because it does play such a big role in the overall environment . I totally agree as well ; many many times I take a bag with me just to pick up what others have left behind on the beach to help wildlife sustain a living space free of trash .
I have always wanted a pet skunk . I ' m not sure if that ' s a good idea though . It certainly seems risky as the animals are known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong , unpleasant smell . Can you get their sprayer fixed so it can ' t do that anymore ? I ' m not sure honestly , and that seems kind of unethical in my opinion . I do know that skuns are omnivorous , meaning they eat both plant and animal material . You have a good point . That wouldn ' t be very nice . Probably not a good idea for a pet . I didn ' t know they were omnivorous either . I ' m glad you agree , I also read that all skunks are striped , even from birth , how neat is that ? That is really neat . I guess it ' s better just to learn about them than to keep them in captivity . I ' m glad I asked .
Lady Gaga is so weird but interesting as well , since she is so well known for her provocative and unconventional work . I frankly must have been sleeping through her rise to fame . I know what you mean . Also even if she is weird , she started off like any small singer performing at open mic nights and school plays . Well that is a good story . I ' m afraid that I must live under a rock though . Like Patrick from Spongebob ! Have you never heard of her at all ? She has topped the US charts many times . Well sure I have , but I couldn ' t pick her out of a crowd other than that I expect she dresses ridiculously . That ' s fair enough , it ' s really impressive that someone so strange can make tracks that are so popular that they sell over a million songs in less than a week on iTunes .
I love The Beatles , Love Me Do is one of my favorite songs of theirs , made all the way back in late 1962 . The Beatles are a classic , when did they first form ? I believe they formed in Liverpool in 1960 . Such a long time ago , arguably the biggest band of all time , had such a massive impact on the music industry . Who was your favorite member ? It has to be Ringo Starr , who didn ' t join until 1962 after they tried a few other drummers , guess he was that good they knew he was the one . Im a John Lennon guy myself , tragic what happened to him , sadly we have some sick and twisted people in this world . It is quite sad , mental illness is quite the big topic nowadays given our current culture . I was quite fond the songwriting partnership he formed with McCartney myself . My favorite of theirs is probably A Day in the Life , they wrote so many famous songs . Their popularity is certainly enermous , it ' s not wonder it was called Beatlemania , it really was like a mania .
hello , are you a vegetarian ? It just so happens that I am . I abstain from eating meat . That was the best decision of your life Thanks . I agree . My motivations were health - related .

My number 1 motivation was my health , what about yours ?
My son loves Comic books , but I know literally nothing about them ! Are you a comic book fan ? I know a bit about them . Comic books are a publication that has sequential panels that represent individual scenes . Sounds interesting ! What are some of the most popular comic books ? Super hero comic books are very popular , though comic books originated in Japan in the 18th century . Oh wow ! I had no idea they ' ve been around that long . I ' ll bet those early Japanese ones were beautiful ! Yeah , one of the main things that comic books rely on is their organization I ' ll bet there are a lot of great stories ! I think one of my favorite shows , The Walking Dead , started as a comic book ! Yes , it was based on the comic book series by Robert Kirkman , Tony Moore , and Charlie Adlard . Nice , I ' ll have to check them out one day ! What else can you tell me about comic books ?
As much as I love cooking and have a TON of fun doing it , I don ' t think I ' d cut it on a shop like Top Chef . Yes I love that show , I really love how it has lots of chefs competing against each other in various culinary challenges . It makes it more interesting . And there ' s usually a required ingredient , which is something insane like beer or lemons or something . Why are these shows so popular ? People just like food shows , Top Chef actually got so popular that they made another show called " Top Chef Junior ", It features ypung contestants in their early teens , It was premiered in October 2017 on Universal Kids . Yeah I try to avoid watching that one , because I don ' t need to feel like my childhood was worthless compared to these kids who can already cook better than me . Indeed , some people I know dont like that show , But it can make kids more interested in cooking and get into a culinary work for their career . That ' s the hope at least , right ? I feel like most of the time the way it plays out is that kids just want to get in the way in the kitchen .
Heavy metal music has roots in blues and acid rock . I have never heard of acid rock , what is that ? I like Heavy rock but not wuite metal Acid rock features distorted guitars and lyrics centered around drugs . Ah , did it originate back in the 70s or 80s then ? Around the 60s , think psychedelic when it comes to Acid Rock . Think LSD too lol Ah okay , that makes more sense then . Are you a fan of the genre at all ? Heavy metal , not much , nor Acid Rock . I ' m not too familiar with either personally . I understand that , Heavy rock is as far as I go , anything past that feels a bit too " edgy " I guess Yeah , Heavy Metal is very aggressive , at least I feel that way personally .
Skateboarding is a hobby of mine , I am not good at it , but I like it I used to skateboard , but I really didn ' t have a lot of tricks up my sleeve . Most of the time I was just babysitting my younger brother at skate parks . I understand that , I started liking it when my oldest son got involved , I still love to watch the Dew Tour when it comes on I haven ' t really watched the Dew Tour . The only extreme sports event I used to watch was the X Games for it ' s first few years . I ' ve been out of it for a while . It is amazing how far Tony Hawk took the sport , and that he still dabbles in it , but his oldest son skates too I remember playing his original video game . Tony Hawk ' s Pro Skater on the N64 . That was really awesome back in the day . It was on the n64 , it was really cool hoe you could sometimes skate through the walls .. lol ... I like the tricks like the ollie I remember once I learned to do an ollie myself , I tried to move to the kickflip . I don ' t think I ever mastered the kickflip . The kickflip is really hard , I remember practicing for hours at a time , and never mastering it
I love me some Netflix ! Do you like it ? Yeah I love Netflix , which is an American company . Yes , and they sure have became very popular . I bet they are in the top of their league , compared to other companies ? Netflix really took the lead over other companies like Blockbuster . Yes , and I think they are pretty much out of business almost everywhere now . I imagine they may be doing better than Dish Network and Direct TV too ? They must be , since cable is dying . Netflix was founded back in August 1997 . I had no idea it had been around that long , so I guess it has taken some time to rise to the top . Do you have a favorite Netflix show ? Of all the shows on Neflix , I really like the show Trailer Park Boys . It isn ' t American though , it ' s Canadian . Unlike Netflix the company . I had no idea it had been around that long , so I guess it has taken some time to rise to the top . Do you have a favorite Netflix show ?
One of my favorite foods is Macaroni and cheese , do you like Mac n Cheese ? Macaroni and cheese is my number one comfort food ! No lie , I eat it at least 5 times a week ! It ' s such a good go to . I could eat it every day . I sometimes put little bacon bits in it or some bread crumbs . Do you like yours with anything extra ? There ' s other dried and fresh pastas that I ' ll add things to , but I hate anything in my macaroni . I like it pure lol Haha , a Mac n Cheese purist . Plain Macaroni is perfect by itself anyways . Yes I am :) funny enough , I know Kraft innovated the whole " cheese powder , milk , and butter " thing , but I really don ' t like the Kraft macaroni . As much as I can enjoy some Kraft Box Macaroni , I prefer homemade baked mac n cheese with a light crisp on the top .
I was thinking about becoming a yoga instructor but I don ' t know much about it . Do you ? I do . The word yoga means " listen " in Sanskrit . It ' s a group of practices of both a physical and spiritual bent . Oh really ? Listen ....... that is interesting . I guess listen to your body ? Kind of , yes . In India where yoga comes from , it is more than physical exercise . Meditation and spirituality are also an important part of the practice . Oh yes I have heard this as well . I have been learning to meditate recently . :) Meditation is a great way to reduce stress and anxiety . Meditative practices also originated in Asia . Yeah , they are all very spiritual people in that part of the world . I would love to visit there one day . It ' s a wonderful part of the world . It was actually yoga gurus from India who brought yoga to the West . Yes , they are so merciful to bring this knowledge to the west . We are so fortunate ! Indeed we are . If you ' re looking to get into yoga , the two most popular types are Hatha yoga and Raja yoga . Might be worth looking into !
In some institutions a bachelors degree is a graduate degree not an undergraduate degree . For real ? How does that even work ? The student can ' t start a bachelor degree until a first degree has been completed , probably like an AA . And then when applying for jobs do you think it makes a difference ? Like I want to get a master ' s so I ' ll be slightly more valuable to potential employers . Really depends on your profession , in some cases a masters degree can make you too valuable and companies wont hire you , in most cases its a good thing to have a masters though . what are you trying todo ? Well I ' m a biologist by training , but I really want to work at the CDC . I was thinking about getting a master ' s in microbiology because just a four year degree isn ' t usually enough for these government agencies . masters should definitely help , its sounds counter intuitive but if you go for a phd it can make it easier to get your schooling for free . at least it does in engineering I actually thought about pursuing a PhD after college , but I felt that I wasn ' t smart enough to get into any labs . if you can get into a masters program , it shouldnt be too hard to get into a lab just gotta network and get in with the right people .
My girlfriend and I enjoy watching Disney ' s animated theatrical films , like The Little Mermaid . Do you watch them ? Yes ! I grew up with those films . They are so good . Have you seen Frozen ? It ' s based on an old HCA fairy tale : " The Snow Queen ." It ' s nice to see old stories get updated treatments ! Frozen was a good love story . I really liked the snowman . He was funny Olaf and a lot of the other characters ended up being too symbolic in the screenplay drafting process . The original fairy tale was just that good ! fun fact the caracters in frozen were named after Hans Christian Andersen . Hans , Kristoff , Anna , Sven Kristoff reminds me of me when I was in my early twenties : tall , rugged , and handsome . I definitely qualify for that last one ... Haha , im more like sven or Olaf It would be a great drinking game to play . Every time a character exactly resembles you or a friend , take a shot !
Do you like Toyota vehicles ? They are the worlds largest market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles Hi . I have never had a Toyota but I know a lot of people like them . We own a toyota camry but not one of their hybrid electric vehicles We have mainly owned chevy and Nissan . I love my Nissan , I have never had a hybrid electric vehicle before . I haven ' t either . I read that cumulative global sales of of Toyota and Lexus hybrid passenger cars achieved the 10 million mark in Jan 2017 Wow , that is great . I think if we ever considered a electric vehicle we probably would go with Tesla . I have heard those are great cars . They say the prius is good . It is the worlds top selling hybrid with over 6 million units sold worldwide

You can still have fun as an adult though . There ' s plenty of activities to do . Do you know how long people have been celebrating Halloween ? Not exactly but it ' s believed that Halloween traditions date back to ancient Celtic harvest festivals , so it must be a really old holiday ! Wow , so cool ! I wonder what types of things people would wear as a costume back then ? I wonder ! Halloween is actually a three - day observance of Allhallowtide , a time of year dedicated to remembering the dead . The holiday sure has evolved ! Ooo spooky ! I never knew people would remember the dead on Halloween . Do you know why people carve pumpkins ?

I believe a variety of instruments though I don ' t know specifics . I could easily find out because the piece debut album actually came out in 1955 ! So recent !

Yes -- all dairy products make you have gas or indigestion ; however , there are things you can do about it . I ' m thinking about taking Lactaid tablets to avoid having gas and nausea every time I consume lactose . They do help , also you can get lactose free milk which is really good . I was happy to learn that Lactose intolerance does not cause damage to your gastro tract ! Still , I need to avoid consuming too much of it , it isn ' t a pleasant feeling ! True , but sometimes a little gas is worth the effort , especially for a milkshake . I agree . At least I was prepared for this , I was aware that as you age , it ' s more likely you will get primary lactose intolerance . Definitely the aging process has a lot to do with lactose intolerance , it appears to get worse as you age .
My favorite place to travel to is Jamaica ! It ' s an island in the Caribbean sea ! Have you been ? No I haven ' t ! I bet it ' s a relaxing place to visit . Yeah , Jamaica is a great little place just south of Cuba and west of Hispaniola ! Nice beaches ! Is there anything else Jamaica is known for ? Well it ' s important to know that the island was a possession of Spain until 1655 ! Interesting , I did not know that . Is it an independent country now ? Yeah it was later conquered by England and named Jamaica ! Now it ' s independent !
I saw a documentary on snakes , did you realize they have skulls , that let them swallow prey much larger than their head ? i know , they are pretty awesome . did you see how they manage to breath while they ' re eating ? Wild , their paired organs aren ' t side - by - side and they only have one lung , because of their narrow body . i did not know that . only one lung , that is crazy . Did you know that despite how awesome they are , they can ' t manage to eat a full grown adult You hear they can , but I doubted it , but some species have a pelvic girdle and vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca . i never heard of claws in snakes before . which snake did the documentary talked about ? There were many , but that elongated , legless body of a snake really creeps me out , so I couldn ' t watch long .
So something interesting about me . I ride unicycle , a bike - like thing with only one wheel . that amazing , i have no sense of balance so even riding a bike is hard for me It is surprisingly easy once you get used to it . There are even activities for unicyclists that are similar to mountain biking trials . the only thing i know about unicycles that they were make in the 1870s Yes there were a couple patents . One by Frederick Myers and the other by Battista Scuri . how do you control it when you hit big bumps with no handle bars When a rider is on the unicycle it is unusually stable . With a trained rider they are said to be more stable than a bicycle .
Sculpting or sculpture is a branch of the fine arts . It is visual in nature , and it operates in three dimensions . Do you know much about sculture ? No I don ' t but I would like to know more The sculptural process originally was performed in two ways . First was carving ; that is , the removal of material from a block of wood or stone , for example . The second way is modelling , which is the addition of material ( clay for example ) on another material . sounds very cool please tell me more about it In the early period of sculpting , such as the classical period , for the most part materials were limited to stone , metal , ceramics , and wood . However , since " Modernism ," the materials used are almost limitless . Very interesting is there anything else I should know about scultping ? If you are interested in sculpting , and you want it to stand the test of time , the best material to use is stone . Other materials , such as wood , perish quite quickly in the process of time . Sculpting with pottery is your second best option if you find stone too difficult to sculpt .
I was raised on the Beatles as a kid . My parents played them all the time They ' re great ! They started in Liverpool in 1960 . Yes and Beetlemania hit the states in 1963 . They were everywhere Yes , the primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney were highly influential on the evolution of pop music Unfortunately the broke up . Their final studio album was titled Let it Be . It ' s true ! In 1969 , Lennon privately told the other members that he was leaving the group The following year , all four former Beatles released solo projects .
Hi , I know far too little , but have always been interesting in Bible study . To start off , the Bible is pretty much just a record of the relationship between humans and God . I believe it also to be a guide for the best way to live our lives . Many different authors contributed to the Bible with their sacred scriptures . I totally agree . Though many would disagree , the Bible is the Only book that contains absolutely No contradictions . There is some disagreement among different denominations . Protestants focus on scripture alone , while roman catholics stress harmony . This is true . I personally do not believe in denominations . Christ established His church . All others are corruptions created by man . Denominations or not , nowadays there is a total of more than two billion Christians worldwide . Professing to be Christian does not make it so .
I love the ocean , mostly because I love to surf ! and kneeboarding I am not familiar with Kneeboarding , what is that ? Knee boarding is alot like surfboarding , but its a special board that ridden in a kneeling stance That makes sense , is there an advatnage to doing it that way ? Its just a different way of doing things haha , oddly enough surfing refers to the act of riding a wave , regardless of how That is interesting , I have only tried to surf on those fake machines that make a wave Oh nice ! Those are fun ! surfers can actually use bother those and artifical waves made from boats and artificial wave pools I did not know they had boats to make waves too . I have seen some surfing on tv , it looks very difficult Yeah it is haha , but not as tough as what the native people of the Pacific do , they surf on alaia paipo and wooden bark trees
Sephora is so pretty i love it The french chain store ? Its a brand of make up Actually it ' s a store that sells 300 brands in the store including there own brand which is made in china . O wow i had no idea they were so big ! Yes , first launched in Paris on August 14 , 1969 and have since spread around the world . Yeah i think it is the best in the world !
Steak is my favorite food I like mine grilled medium rare The word " steak " would also refer to many different meats like fish or pork . Oh yeah I prefer beef steak but I will eat chicken or pork How do you eat your steak ? I usually like eating mine with a sauce . Oh no sauce for me but a baked potatoe on the side Do you like to grill , pan - fry , or broil your steak ? I really prefer to grill but will pan fry if its bad weather I like grilling too , lets you get that good flavor having it over the coals and the fire . Yes but if pan fry you have to get a fast sear on first
I love traditional italian food , especially pizza . i like pizza to and spaghetti I just like pizza the most because it can be topped with so many things , like meats and vegetables . whats your fav toppings They have got to be pepperoni for meats and mushrooms for vegetables . man i hate mushrooms lol but pepperoni is de wae Agreed , I love meats like pepperoni and sausage on pizza . Mushrooms are great though . i would spinach or some kind of pepper to replace the mushrroms I really don ' t like that many vegetables on it , like spinach or green peppers . Meats are the best toppings to be topped on pizza .
I own an upholstery shop where we provide furniture with padding , springs , and fabric or leather covers . Oh really that sounds fun what do you do ? I ' m the owner of the business and an upholsterer and I have an apprentice called an outside or trimmer . What does the trimmer do that sounds like a cool title . He watches and learns while I upholster things like automobile , airplane , and boat seats mostly . That seems like really hard work , actually having to use your hands and build stuff . It is pretty hard sometimes . We do everything by hand building each layer up . How long do it take to master and become amazing ? It depends on how fast you learn really and how far you ' d like to go in the profession . In 18th - century London upholsterers were actually interior decorators as well so that took longer I ' m sure .
I love playing magic the gathering with some friends its really fun Cool , Magic : the Gathering is a trading card game . yep its one of the big classics , its super expensive though sadly That ' s too bad . It was created by Richard Garfield and published in 1993 . yea it had its 25th anniversary this year Awesome , players can create their own decks , usually 60 cards and no more than 4 of a single card . yep thats the standard deck style though there are loads of formats Magic can also be played with virtual cards on a smartphone or computer . yep theres a computer version though its buggy
I have a weird hobby . I collect postage stamps That ' s actually really cool ! How often do you actually find new ones worth collecting ? I was just about to say , I haven ' t found many new stamps to collect these days in the age of email and digital shipping labels . I figured things would get a lot harder for people who collected stamps , I mean it makes sense .. What are some of your favorite stamps ? My favorite stamp , my most prized stamp is one they made for Calvin and Hobbes as part of a series on newspaper comics . It is one of the only officially licensed pieces of Calvin and Hobbes merchandise , ever . Holy cow ! That ' s so sweet ! Having those prized possessions definintely makes hobbies a lot more enjoyable ! I might want to see if I can scare up a few more copies of the stamp , just for posterities sake . I think I felt the same way my grandfather did when he collected thing ( he collected coins , btw ) Oh nice , my father collected coins back when I was a lot younger ... But I do agree , you should get a few more copies , never let that hobby die ! Collecting stamps a great way to support the Post office too , which is semmingly under siege by some stupid law about paying 75 years of retirement benefits or something like that .
I really love watching horror movies ! Love the fright they give me . Do you know of any goods ones ? Yes I like all the Halloween movies and all the Purge movies I think I have watched Halloween before ! That ' s the one that takes place in Haddonfield , Illinois ! What are the Purge movies about ? Purge is scary about one night a year when people can commit any crime including murder without consequences , very scary ! That would be a pretty scary world to live in . Do you think it ' s better than the film " Scream "? I know it ' s a bit dated , coming out in 1996 , but it ' s still a great movie . Never saw scream ? I like the Silence of the Lambs too , that is a real horror flick ! Yes ! I love Silence of the Lambs ! Anthony Hopkins played his role incredibly well ... he was so creepy !
I am not yet a parent , but it will be interesting to raise a child and learn good parenting skills . I ' d like to be a " good parent ". I am not a parent yet either but I couldn ' t agree more I definitely think it is important to try and be the best parent you can be ! Parenting seems like a process of predictable sequences , but they may turn out different for each child . That ' s a good point , I guess every child is different so they probably each deal with parenting styles differently . I ' ve heard that the quality of parenting likely matters more than the amount of time spend with the child . I guess it is the time you spend with them that counts , having to make the time really important and really appreciating the years you have with them ! That ' s very true . In some cases , society also plays an important role in raising a child as well . That ' s true also , I sometimes worry the world we are living in now will be detrimental to the way children are raised . Those so much in the world that can have such huge impacts . I agree , it is hard . Studies tend to have trouble identifying the impacts because respondents often respond to feel ideal rather than how things are .
Everywhere i went today , people kept mentioning beer . When you are a recovering alcoholic like me , you don ' t want people mentioning your weakness all of the time . Man , that is tough . And good on you for staying strong . Too many people do too many stupid things on alcohol -- driving drunk , risky decisions ... too much . My wife says my weakness is english grammer , but i know it is alcohol . I sometimes crave a drink around holidays , Understandable . It ' s supposed to be " festive ", right ?! And no doubt on the grammar , as alcohol makes a beeline for the brain ( and other organs , like the heart , liver , pancreas ....!) Yes , alcohol will kill you . i used to be a scotch drinker , because scotch is not measured by the shot . Scotch is a free pour , so you get half a water glass worth . That is about 3 shots for the same price as a shot of Tequila . Ah , well , and there you hit on my preferred tipple . Tequila . And I had no idea about scotch ! So how do you stay true to * not * drinking ? Drinking makes it hard to type , so i was forced to choose between using the internet or drinking . Hopefully i made the right choice . You know what ? I ' m cheering for you . Obviously your brain is way to beautiful to waste . ( And the spectre of cirrhosis , increased risk of cancer , etc .... good motivation ) Thanks . If you try scotch , stay away from the blends like Johnny Walker , they are like jet fuel . Many of the single malt scotches are quite nice and drinkable . Roger that . I ' ve got Scot in my blood , so I ' m thinking my body would rebel against anything less than a single malt .
I was trying to remember the Walt Disney Pictures films I use to watch . There are many Disney movies like Cinderella and Frozen , Actually The studio has produced over 56 films , from " Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , My personal favorite is Moana which came out in 2016 That is a lot of Walt Disney Pictures films . They must be very successful . They are are ! The Walt Disney Animation studio was founded way back on October 16 , 1923 , Its division of The main Walt Disney Studios . Oh wow . Anything else you can tell me about their history ? Yes In fact Disney was founded on October 16 , 1923 by two brothers by the name of Walt Disney and Roy O . Disney Oh okay . I believe I heard those names before . Did Walt Disney Pictures start making films that long ago ? Yes the first movie was released all the way back in 1937 , The movie was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs I didnt realize it was that old . Im sure Walt Disney Pictures has won many awards .
Do you know anything about Madonna . I know she was popular a while back if I recall . Yes I own all of her albums . Most of her works have been pretty highly praised by many music critics even to this day Cool . I was wondering if she was still relevant . Did she make a lot of albums ? I think she has over 60 albums believe it or not , thats a lot . Unbelievable . She must have a good work ethic . Yea she really reinvented both her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the massive recording industry , which I hear is hard to do . Do you know where Madonna grew up ? She was Born and raised in the state of Michigan , She moved to New York City in 1978 when she first wanted to get a career in dancing . Oh cool . So she started as a dancer before she began her singing career . Im assuming that is how she got discovered .
My favorite food is burritos . They are delicious . Interetingly burrito is a dish in Mexican and Tex - Mex cuisine Is it really an authentic Mexican dish ? When were burritos invented ? The name " burrito ", as applied to the dish , possibly derives from the appearance of bedrolls , related to packs carried by donkeys That ' s interesting I didn ' t know they were named after that . What is the traditional burrito made out of ? We also have the burro percherón is a traditional dish in the Mexican state of Sonora . What exactly is a burro percheron ? Is that a special type of burrito ?
I love making cupcakes so much that I opened my own cupcake business ! I specialize in making cupcakes with decorations such as fruit and candy ! That sounds delicious ! What is your favorite ? I love chocolate cupcakes decorated with jelly beans ! Sometimes I make jumbo cupcakes for 2 people , even though a typical cupcake is a small cake designed to serve one person That sounds amazing . I be I could eat a 2 person cupcake all by myself . I love chocolate too ! Do you make one with filling on the inside ? I do ! It ' s similar to a Hostess CupCake with a creme filling , but way better , in my own biased opinion ! LOL Those are my favorite actually ! I sometime sneak my them from my kid lunch snacks . I bet your are better though . What a great occupation you chose . I bet you love it ! I do love it ! Interestingly , before muffin tins were in plentiful supply many people made cupcakes in individual pottery cups ! That ' s funny to brought that up . I had an epic Pintrest fail with cupcakes in clay pots It was supposed to look like a potted flower . I bet you would nailed it tho . Have you seen these before ? Yes , and they are quite popular with my customers ! English fairy cakes are popular too - they are a bit smaller than a normal sized cupcake
I do not like dairy especially cheese because it is derived from milk that forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein . I love cheese but not a huge milk fan . Me too . Despite this , I can ' t deny the fact that cheese is popular among others and hundred of types of cheese are produced from multiple countries . Yea and they can use different types of animal milk like goats and cows The style , texture and flavor all depend on where the milk comes from and if they have been pasteurized and aging process . Yep , i love soft goats cheese but things like mozzarella and feta are awesome too Some cheese are just simply curdled milk . But some cheese incorporate herbs , spices , or wood smoke as flavoring agents . Oh yea herbal cheese is so good I also forgot to mention other ingredients like black pepper , garlic , chives or cranberries can be used .
My favorite baseball team is the Baltimore Orioles . I like to watch the games on TV . I grew up in Baltimore , so they were my team as a child ! Cool , my favorite player is Cal Ripken , Jr . He was such an amazing talent . Cal ' s the best ! A 19 - time All - Star ! Yeah his playing streak will never be broken . I really liked Camden Yards but haven ' t been to the new stadium . Camden Yards actually is the new stadium , it was completed in 1992 . Memorial Stadium is the old one , and the one I grew up going to . I hope you make it to the new one sometime , it ' s really nice . Oh that ' s right . I meant Memorial Stadium . Camden does look very nice .
Hi , I am currently a player in the NBA . Wow . The NBA is considered to be the premier men ' s professional basketball league in the entire world ! Yes , it is very difficult to make it to the NBA . I bet ! The NBA is one of the 4 major professional sports leagues in the US and Canada ! As a player , I constantly have to keep improving . I can imagine ! NBA players are the world ' s best paid athletes , so its no wonder it is so competitive . Only room for the best . Yes , big money also means big taxes .
Do you support PETA , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ? yes . It ' s based in Norfolk , Va where I am from originally I support their cause but think their methods can be harmful . How big of an organization is PETA ? I think it has at least 6 million member and about 400 employees if I remember correctly . That is a pretty big reach , do you know how much money they collect ? It must be in the millions at least . no not really . I do like their slogan though , Animals are not ours to eat , wear , experiment on or abuse or use for our entertainment Yes I generally agree but don ' t they sometimes cause a lot of controversy in their protests and campaigns ?
My uncle is a dental surgeon , who specializes in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases of the oral cavity . That ' s interesting , it sounds like a pretty hard job to do . It is , but he has a team full of assistants , hygienists , dental technicians and a dental therapist . Oh , I think a lot of people don ' t like going to the dentist , but it ' s necessary for health to go from time to time . It is necessary . It is good to seek oral health services especially if you are having issues . That ' s true , simple cavities can make big problems and cause pain if they ' re not treated . I recently found out that in China and France , the first people to perform dentistry were barbers !
I ' m about to work in the US Federal Judiciary , do you know anything about it ? That ' s cool ! The federal judiciary of the United States comprises one of three branches of the US federal government . Oh right , that ' s the supreme court right ? Yes , the USA is required to have a Supreme Court by Article III of the Constitution . I see , I didn ' t realize it was required Yes , the judges are appointed by the President , but the Senate must also consent to the choice . Oh wow , what does the Supreme Court do ? The Supreme Court is considered a last resort court . So they only see the most controversial cases .
Do you think people with red / green color - blindness can see purple ? Since it is a mix of red and blue . That ' s a great question . I don ' t know the answer , but I ' m not sure exactly what colors color - blind people can ' t see . Do you know ? I think there are different kinds . Some color blind people can ' t see colors at all , but most just have a hard time differentiating certain colors . I see . I knew a teacher I had in grade school who was color blind . It make sense that if they can ' t see red or blue they probably can ' t see purple either . My boss is color blind . He can ' t differentiate red / green . It makes knowing what to do at a traffic light a bit of a hassle . Hehe So color - blind people just see black and white when non color - blind people see the color ? Yeah , that ' s pretty important to be able to differentiate colors at stop - lights ! Color vision is itself a mind bender . Do you imagine , for example , that you and I both see the color purple as the same color ? Maybe we just have learned it to be purple .
Independent music is often shortened to indie I like some indie music . I don ' t listen to it that much , though . It is produced independently from major commercial record labels Yeah . Do you know any independent artists ? Yes . The term indie is sometimes also used to describe a genre Yeah , that ' s why I thought you were talking about originally , was the genre . And usually create music that can be categorized into other genre

I want to hike more now that we ' re talking about it .
HI , do you enjoy reading historical fiction , with the plot taking place in the past ? No , I greatly prefer historical non - fiction . When I do encounter fiction , I ' m always looking for a way to relate it to real life . Ah yes , I understand that . Many writers of historical fiction are criticized for lack of authenticity in terms of getting accurate details for the time period . Can you think of any historical non - fiction books off the top of your head ? Well there is a writer by the name of Charles Price , who writes historical non - fiction set in Civil War times . Oh now that might be interesting . That makes me think of old western movies that were mostly fabricated by historically it could have happened . Yes , it takes a lot of research to get details right . The writers really need to do a lot of research . There ' s tension between accuracy and a good fictional story .
My friend has a yorkshire terrier , they are cute dogs Yes they are ! Do you know where the breed comes from ? 19th century yorkshire , they were bred to kill rats Oh cool ! I seen a video about that . It was pretty gross . does your friends dog do that too ? No his yorkshire just runs around trying to lick people , hes a cool little dog Nice , I had a Burmese Mountain Dog but he passed away recently sadly . Oh thats sad i love Bernese Mountain dogs they are so big and fluffy and gentle
I love the study of insects , or entomology in the scientific realm if you will . ok when did the study of insects start The study of insects is rooted in prehistoric times . People have ben studying insects since humans have been around . it wasn ' t an official science until the 16 century however . isn ' t this same as zoology ? Entomoloy is a branch of zoology . Just like all camry ' s are toyota ' s , but not all toyota ' s are camrys oh good to know Yeah because it is in the scope of zoology , entomology typically crosses with a lot of other sciences , such as molecular genetics , biochemistry , etc .
I used to go To Las Vegas more often when I lived in Los Angeles , have you ever been ? I have never been , but always wanted to go . Vegas is renowned for their resorts , gambling , shopping , and fine dining . It sounds so fun ! It is a fun place to visit , Do you gamble at all ? No , but it really does sound fun . One of my friends went to Caesars Palace and had the greatest time at the casino . I like to go to the sports book at Ceasars Palace and bet on Football . The Bellagio and the Wynn also have nice sports books Oh yes , I heard the Bellagio is famed for its elegance . I would love to go . The Bellagio is a nice hotel , many of the hotels on the Las Vegas strip are very nice

My family had a fish farm Hi ! That is interesting ! What kind of fish ? We reared salmon and Catfish Nice , I like the taste of salmon . Do you like to eat fish ? of course I do , it ' s just that I wanted to pursue my own career that ' s why I left the business That makes sense ! New horizons are sometimes needed . I hope to have my own business someday . Fish farming is easy but it requires your full attention . If you need a business that does not need your full attention then you can consider IT . game building for example , check buildbox on google :)
I love Walmart ! It is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets I enjoy shopping there too ! Do you know when the first one was opened ? If I recall that would be October 31 , 1969 How many countries around the world have a Walmart ? It is in 28 and operates Sam ' s Club retail warehouses . Cool , how long after Walmart opened did the first Sam ' s Club open ? Im not sure but Walmart is the world ' s largest company by revenueapproximately US $ 480 billion . Wow . I ' m curious where it got its name from ? It is the original owners names . It is a publicly traded family - owned business
Have you heard of India ? It is a country in South Asia Yes I have . I have seen movies that show it , watched documentaries that travel through it but can embarrassingly admit that I know nothing about it . Where is it located ? Well , its the seventh - largest country by area located in southeast Asia ! Wow and whats the population density like . I heard that its quite over populated ? Yes over 1 . 2 billion people live there ! Sadly , I think that has resulted in many problems for the country Wow that is a lot of people . Can you tell what problems they are facing due to this over population ? For one , overpopulation has resulted in the degradation of the capacity of the environment to give support to the population . Oh yeah the more people the less resources . Whats the main industry in India , is it textile ? Mainly fishing , since it is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south and the Arabian Sea on the southwest .
I love me some Pepsi - Cola ! I like it so much better than Coke . I can see why , Coke is great but it is really really sweet and hard to drink a lot of . Pepsi started out being called " Brad ' s Drink " in 1863 ! I thought that was pretty crazy . Really ? That ' s such a strange name ! There ' s also a drink called Pepsi Max that ' s low calorie and sugar free that ' s an alternative to Diet Pepsi . I quite like Diet Pepsi , I drink it more than any other soda . SPeaking of crazy names , Diet Pepsi started out as " Patio Diet Cola " in 1963
When I was younger I wanted to go to law school . Law school can be long and hard . Why didn ' t you follow through with your dream to become a lawyer ? Because I did not want to go through all the schooling ? Do you know how long law school is ? Most law schools only offer a 3 year program , but some schools offer an Accelerated JD program Do you know how many lawyers are in the United States ? I figure it is a pretty large number I don ' t know , a whole lot though . You can get a Master of Laws which is LL . M . Those are the smart lawyers . Also a Doctor of Juridical Science J . S . D ., even smarter I always wanted to be a prosecutor . Do they have to do additional schooling ?
Are you a vegetarian ? I ' m not currently but I was previously . I think vegetarianism has its roots in ancient India and Greece . I think so too In both cases I believe it was based on the idea of nonviolence towards animals and it was even promoted by religious groups . Yeah , I dont really care about the religious aspect , but I definitely care about animals . It ' s definitely good not to inflict unnecessary violence in my opinion . It ' s too bad vegetarianism is so rare , only 0 . 5 - 4 % of the Western world is vegetarian based on 2006 data . Thats so few people . Kind of ridiculous in this day and age . I don ' t have the current data , but I think it ' s growing in popularity as people consider the health - related and environmental benefits as well . Im sure it is . The Internet is raising people ' s awareness of animal rights issues .
Fashion design involves the application of design to clothing and accessories . I watch a couple of fashion design shows . Oh cool , fashion designers work in many ways designing things such as bracelets and necklaces . I have friends who design bracelets . Yes , the fashion designers also design clothes that are functional too . That ' s true , though I tend to like seeing the really out there stuff they design . The fashion designers have a wide range of materials to work with to suit many situations . And sometimes , they use things that aren ' t even fabric ! It ' s amazing . Fashion designers designs are utilized by manufacturers .
Loves me some Pican Pie ! So simple yet so good . Just Pecans , Eggs , Butter , and Sugar ! Are there different ways you can make it ? Yes , variations may include white or brown sugar , sugar syrup , molasses , maple syrup or honey . I love the center gooey part , what is that ? The filling is typically Eggs , Butter and Sugar Is there a way to make it healthy ? Well natives were quite healthy , and they ate Picans regularly . The pie however traces back to 8000 years ago .
I used to have a horse , but I don ' t anymore . I think I might like to get one again . I used to have one as well . They are more work than people think . That ' s true . They have to be fed , watered , and groomed , plus you have to make sure they stay in their enclosures . There are some wild horse populations near me , on North Carolina ’ s outer banks . I think I read some very famous books about them , they ' re by Marguerite Henry . I loved Margeurite Henry ’ s books when I was young . Misty of Chincoteague was one of my favorites . I really liked that one too , but my favorite of hers is King of the Wind . I still have a copy of it now . That was a good one . I think it was about the Godolphin Arabian , which was the foundation for the modern Arabian breed .
I have seen some really cool cookie jars lately , but I learned in the UK they are called biscuit jars or barrels . why do they call them biscuits instead of cookies ? Well the British cooking writer Elizabeth David uses it in a section called Soft Biscuits . Then has bread and tea cakes in a different part , so there is another meaning . I see . I love the British Baking show on PBS . They cook all sorts of interesting things . I have heard of that show . I heard they moved it from BBC Two to BBC One because it was so popular after the first four seasons . I did not know there were two channels of BBC ! That is interesting . I have only seen their news shows Yes . It has actually been around since April 21 , 1964 . Wow . That is towards the very beginning of when tv first started . It certainly has been around longer than some other well known channels , like MTV . They weren ' t around until August of 1981 .
I love the show Battlestar Galactica ! It ' s a military , science fiction show . Have you seen it ? I ' ve seen maybe 30 seconds of it at a time , lol . Tons of my friends have , and they adore it . Why do you like it ? It ' s so fascinating ! It ' s set in a distant star system where a group of people live on a group of planets called the Twelve Colonies . I love sci - fi stuff ! Me too ! I ' ve been more of a Star Trek fan for most of my life , but I ' d be open to trying it if you ' re recommending it ! You should ! It was actually given a spot on Time ' s 100 Best TV Shows of All - Time ! It ' s a must - see ! Wow , no kidding . I saw a parody summary of it once where it was just a bunch of people saying " I ' m a Cylon " over and over . Accurate ? Accurate . The Cylons are an android race of their own creation who were at war with the Twelve Colonies . And it ' s supposed to be like a big reveal that a character has been a Cylon the whole time , right ? I don ' t want to spoil that for you ! You have to watch all four seasons on the Sci - Fi channel to find out !
Tom Selleck had a great mustache ! I too have a moustache . I use moustache wax for styling it . I find the wax a little greasy . I sometimes use Beeswax . Since it consists mainly of esters of fatty acids and long chain alcohols , it is somewhat less greasy . That is good to know . I may try it when I grow one again . They ' ve found evidence of moustache ' s dating all the way back to the 4th Egyption Dynasty in 2550 BC . I would imagine they date back to the earliest humans ! Well it was technologically possible to shave away all but the moustache all the way back in Neolithic times . That is what I mean , particularly since more hair was the default in that era .

This is a time to rediscover you and the things that you like to do . I know the divorce just took so much out of me . We realised we just were not compatible anymore . Thinking about when I was younger - I did love dancing and played squash and the cello ?? Dancing that right there will give you an outlet to have a social life . And have you ever considered playing the cello again ? I loved the cello it is such a wonderful string instrument tuned in perfect fifths . Oh thank you , you have got me thinking about all the options now ! That ' s good because there ' s always options . One thing I hear about marriage is that you forget that you are still an individual . Now you can take care of you . That is so true . Both spouses lose their independence and when it doesnt work there are clashes , I am going to be me again !!

Sport utility vehicles are very versatile
I just love the world of finance . There is so much money to be made at your fingertips . Yeah well Finance is a field that deals in the world of investments . How long do you have to go to school to get into finance ? 2 to 4 years . It is technically the study of dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees Finance Some call it the science of money management . I wonder how many different conditions that market can be in . The goal of finance aims to price assets based on their risk level I ' m assuming it ' s better to get low risk assets .
I just started working at an Amazon warehouse . I like it so far ! It is crazy how the company has grown . Amazon started as an online bookstore and slowly started selling other things . It is crazy that a bookstore can take over the online marketplace like they have > Yes , it now has grown to be the largest internet retailer in the world ! Thats impressive !

You are also a Coldplay fan like me Yeah I like quite a few coldplay songs , Viva La Vida or Death and All his Friends was my favorite album , it came out in 2008
I love eating Bagels ! My favorite are blueberry bagels ! Do you enjoy them ? That ' s what I eat : blueberry . I think the blueberries provide relief from the density and chewiness of the bagels . I agree ! Do you make them from scratch or do you buy them from the store ? I ' m afraid I add to the $ 70 million in revenue that Lender ' s Bagels gets . I ' m from the south , so I don ' t know how to make bagels . Donuts , yes . Whoa ! $ 70 million ! I don ' t think I have ever tried a Lender ' s bagel . Where are they from ? It ' s a company started by Murray Lender ( died 2012 ) in Connecticut . I will have to try it ! I particularly like " Killer Dave ' s " bagels . Have you tried that brand ?
I have never had a bone fracture have you Yes , I once had a damage in the continuity of the bone . OH that sounds painful , what is the continuity of bone It just means the full bone is fractured , which may be the result of high force impact or stress Oh I bet that takes longer to heal than a compact fracture I agree , the damage to adjacent structures such as nerves or vessels makes it even longer to heal . I could not imagine the pain of damaging a vessel
My brother just broke his arm , I wonder how much time he will have a cast . A bone fracture is a medical issue when there is damage to the bone continuity . How do bone fractures heal ? The blood then tends to coagulate to create a blood clot that is between the broke fragments . But what happens to the blood clot if the bones move ? Then ithin a few days the blood vessels expand into a jelly like material of a blood clot . ok , so why people do have to wear a cast when they broke a bone ? Then the new blood vessels carry Phagocytes to the injured area which kick out all of the non - viable material .
I like burgers , do you ? I like mine flame broiled . but they can be pan fried or barbecued too . I do not , but I ' ll eat some french fries . I love potatoes too , They ' re called finger chips in India too . I wonder if they are made the same there . I don ' t know . The term burger can also be applied to turkey burgers , or even veggie burgers . I have heard that before . I don ' t eat meat or veggie burgers . Well you ' re in the wrong place then , lol There are many international and regional variations of the burger . Yes I know ! I am not with the majority over here either . Is over there Germany . The term comes from Hamburg , Germany I believe . It ' s the 2nd largest city there .
veganism is one of the best and healthiest diets in my opinion I have read it can reduce risk of some chronic diseases it can also make your metabolism faster , and you become healthier overall . Some people don ' t recommend it for children , adolescents or during pregnancy , though . i personally think it can be really good for those people aswel if there is balance For some people it is more to do with ethical reasons , out of care for animals yes ! this is why i think it ' s a good diet , because it is helpful for everyone ! And beyond that , some vegans think it helps prevent environmental damage environmental damage can be prevented with veganism .
I think Miami might be a cool place to live . Yes I like it because It ' s a port city and I am into exporting of cars so I consider it cool Yeah , I didn ' t know that there was a port there , although given the location it ' s hardly surprising . It is the head quarters of Miami - Dade County and record has it that it has the second largest population in the USA so you sure will meet all kinds of people there . I ' m sure there will be all sorts of people there . I ' d be especially interested in learning more about Cuban culture . Definitely , it has become a global city as well , because it was rated in 2010 as the 7th when you talk about business , cultural experience amongst others It really sounds like a fun place to be . I know a few people who have been there before , and they said that the beaches were amazing , although the urban sprawl is not to everyone ' s liking . Yes it does really sound fun . Another amazing fact is that Forbes Magazine rated it as the cleanest city because of all the initiatives for clean air and other similar programs Was that the cleanest city in the U . S . or globally ? I have to imagine that some European cities would rank higher on a global index .
I love pizza . Me too . Pizza is one of the most traditional Italian dishes . How long has it been around ? The term " pizza " was first identified in an old Latin manuscripts from the 10th century . Wow , I didn ' t know pizza has been in existence for so long . I just love that for pizza you customize it with vegetables , condiments , and meats . Yeah there are so many different ways to make pizza . What ' s your favorite topping ? I like mushrooms best .
Flowers are beautiful and often scented . Do you have any favorites ? do you know flower sometimes known as a bloom or blossom I did not know that .

I think that most flowers are pretty , with obvious exceptions the flower develops into fruit containing seeds after fertilization Flower reproduction has always interested me . Seems to fascinating !
Have you ever watched Friends ? Friends is an awesome comedy . I used to watch it like every week . Joey is the best character .

Do you like the fictional character Monica Geller from friends ? Monica was kind of the worst ! Joey was of course the best . The other fictional character Rachel Green is probably the best girl on the show . Or Rachel . Monica can ruin things sometimes haha . Rachel is definitely the best . David Crane did a good job with actress Jennifer Aniston . The show had like 236 episodes it ' s crazy . Yeah that is crazy , who is David Crane ?
Do you feel that a family can afford to live on minimum wage ? I have mixed feelings It is absolutely possible , it is just that it requires strong self control and good financial behaviors . Generally though , people who have self control and good financial mindsets can do better than minimum wage . I agree . I feel like living at such a low wage has so many drawbacks people need to figure something else out Agreed . The problem I see is that people have a sense that their poor finances are someone elses fault than their own . This attitude ensures that they won ' t apply the discipline necessary to help themselves . Do you support a wage increase ? I ' m against it but supporters say it will reduce poverty . I feel like it would give people a reason not to try to better them self I don ' t think it will reduce poverty at all . I think it will just move the bar on what begets poverity . I agree . I can understand poverty in a developing country but america offers jobs and education . Minimum wage advocates seem to believe ( incorrectly ) that people in the marketplace won ' t change their behaviors to work around the minimum wage . Humans are dynamic and adaptive , all you ' re doing is trying to stop a river with a single post . They are the same people that keep throwing people at a problem and never fixing it . I work for one of those people . I would like to see an honest study on the current living wage .
My dad is a butcher and I want to learn That ' s interesting . Does your dad slaughter animals , dress their flesh , sell their meet , or some combination of the three ? He cuts them for the local market I see . Many butchers work for a supermarket , grocery store , or butcher shop , though some may be self - employed He works at a plant close to his home That ' s convenient . It would be cool to work in such an ancient trade Yeah it has to make you feel cool to process the meat Some areas expect a three - year apprenticeship to be a butcher . Did your dad have to do that ? Im not sure he grew up doing it
I like to play video games . Cool , what kind of video games do you like to play ? I love Grand Theft Auto . That ' s on Xbox right ? It was originally released for MS - DOS . Interesting . Do you play video games on other types of systems ? No , only on the Misrosoft Disk Operating System .

I recently visited New York , a city with an estimated population of 8 . 5 million . I love New York , but it is very busy Indeed , New York is a melting pot of different cultures and over the last decade is growing faster than the region .

I also like the culture in Brooklyn . Yes , Brooklyn its New York ' s fourth - smallest country by land area but the second largest among the cities five boroughs .
Stamp collecting is a really good hobby . There ' s also Philately which is the study of stamps . funny name Philately , I sort of collected when i was a kid It is strange ! The word is the Engilsh version of the french word " philatélie ". does the word directly mean stamp collecting or is it generally means collecting I ' m not sure , but it was coined in 1864 by Georges Herpin . interesting that the english did not use their own word instead of using a french word I have no idea why . Stamp collecting has also been one of the nation ' s most popular hobbies since the late 1900s . i think every body at least tried stamp collecting or coin collecting at one point in their lives I have definitely had a coin collection . My grandfather gave me a lot of mint coins that were never touched .
Have you ever been snorkeling ? I have been snorkeling in the Bahamas . It ' s fun but I don ' t enjoy the masking fogging up . I ' ve never been - was it hard to do or scary ? No , it ' s not scary at all . But you do have to be in a tropical location to really enjoy it . My girls have played around the jetties at panama city beach and looked at some fish through their goggles but i guess it ' s not the same thing Panama city is nice due to it ' s white , sand beaches but the snorkeling is best over a tropical reef . I think I might be worried about bigger fish coming to a reef for a snack LOL ! Coral reefs have such a complex biodiversity to them that you ' ll get all sorts of creatures . My favorites are the sea turtles . I would love to see the sea turtles up close - i have some friends that swam with them in Hawaii
I am pleased that hybrid vehicles have been invented to save on carbon emissions Yes , the use of two types of power really cuts down on carbon emissions . What are the two types of power ? It depends , but some are combustion with gas and battery electric Are they affordable for the average person ? They can be costly , but the tax incentives like a tax credit can offset that cost . That is a good point . What else do you know about them ?
I used to crochet when I was a kid ! Do you crochet ? I love to Crochet . Are you aware the word crochet is derived from the Old French ? I had no idea ! What does it mean ? Crochet is a diminutuve of " croche ", and also related to the Germanic ' croc ', which incidentally both mean " hook ". Well , since one uses a hook , that makes perfect sense ! Have you ever made anything successfully crocheting ? I have crocheted several items using Tunisian crochet ( also known as Afghan crochet ), such as a wedding dress , a pair of slippers for my cat , and a hat for my Husband . Wow that sounds exciting . How long did the hat take to make ?
What kind of phone do you use ? I love my iPhone . I got the first gen version back in 2007 and have stuck with iPhone ever since . I have an iPhone as well . I really like it too ! I have the iPhone 7 . Haven ' t made the move to the iPhone 8 . I ' m thinking about getting the Plus or the iPhone X that came out last year . I think mine is just the 6 but I like it and so I ' m still good with it . I try and stick with what I ' ve got fr as long as I can . The X sounds so cool though . Apple is using it to show what they think is the technology of the future , like wireless charging . Yes , I ' m sure it has some fantastic features . I used android phones for a long time , so this one is my first iPhone . Oh , my husband loves the Androids . He goes with whatever the latest is from Samsung . He prefers the mobile operating system that Google came up with for Android .
Goodfellas is one of my favorite movies . It is a 1990 crime film directed by Martin Scorsese . I ' ve never seen that one before , what ' s it about ?

Do you love painting ? commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo , was an Italian Renaissance polymath whose areas of interest included invention , painting , sculpting , I ' ve always wanted to try but stuck with drawing all my life . Da Vinci sounds like a very talented artist . He has been variously called the father of palaeontology , ichnology , and architecture , What types of inventions did Da Vinci come up with in his life ? He has been credited with the inventions of the parachute , helicopter and tank , h That ' s incredible . Some of these inventions weren ' t even created until after his death like the helicopter , right ? I wonder how he had such wisdom . Many historians and scholars regard Leonardo as the prime exemplar of the " Universal Genius " or " Renaissance Man ",
I can ' t wait for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo , I ' d love to go to Tokyo one day . I would love to go also . It ' s a major international multi - sport competition where the best athletes compete . Absolutely , and Tokyo is such an interesting place , and has so many people there , it must be so packed all the time . Yes , the greater Tokyo area is the metropolitan area in the world with the most population . That ' s wild , how many people are there roughly if you know ? In 2016 the United Nations estimated the population to be about 38 million ! That ' s crazy ! That ' s almost five times as many people in my entire state . Have you ever heard of Akihabara ? Yes , isn ' t it considered to be an Otaku cultural center and a shopping area for anime , manga , video games , and computers ? Yeah that ' s right , it ' s probably going to get a lot of business when the Olympics happen . I wonder how many events are at the Olympics , seems like so many .
Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do . It ' s a naturally occurring state of the body where there is inhibited consciousness and lack of interactions with your surroundings . I love to sleep , I wish I had more time to do so though ! Sleep is very important . While sleeping the body systems are in an anabolic state which helps to restore the immune , nervous , skeletal , and muscular systems . Yeah it is a great way for us to recover from everything we do throughout the day , it ' s really interesting when you think about it . It ' s also interesting that our body has an internal clock called a circadian clock that promotes sleep at night time . Yeah it is , I wonder how people deal with the long days and nights near the poles . They probably have a Non - 24 - hour sleep - wake disorder which messes with the natural sleep cycle . Yeah I hear that also causes issues with depression . Yes when someone has an irrecgular sleep - wake rhythm it can cause them to take naps throughout the day and not have a main sleep time .
I am a night owl , I can ' t seem to make myself go to sleep early , I always end up staying up really long . Me too ! I am the total opposite of an early bird who loves to wake up early ! I get stronger as the night grows ! lol I understand , it ' hard to wake up early during the day . In Scandanavia , they refer to early birds as A People and night owls as B People ! lol I wish I knew where they came up with that ! I never heard of it , I kind of like early bird and night owl phrases more to be honest . I ' ve always wanted to visit Scandinavia . Interestingly , the term night owl refers to the primary nocturnal habits of the owl ! haha Yes I always thought so , just like early bird refers to bird that wake up right when the sun rises on the horizon .
Have you ever been to Portland , Maine ? I know about Porland OR but I didnt know there was one in Maine No , I haven ' t . I didn ' t realize there was one in Maine either . Apparently it is the most populous city in the state of Maine . Oh wow , I wonder why you never hear about it then ! Apparently it is home to over a half a million people , which is more than one third of Maine ' s total population . So it must be a good city to live in . I suppose so . I wonder if there are any strange or weird things about it . Or anything particularly unusual about it I was reading that they are heavily dependent on tourism . The Old Port district is a popular tourist destination Oh okay that would make sense . Are they big on seafood there ?
One of my favorite movies is Disney ' s The Little Mermaid . It was released in 1989 . Have you seen it ? I have seen it , people say it started the era of the disney renaissance I was 10 when it was released and it was one of the first movies I saw in the theater . I remember being very frightened of Ursula ! Not to make you feel old , but that movei caame out in 1989 , almost 30 years ago ! It made 84 million at the box office , which would be a flop by today ' s standards ! Amazing how time flies ! Back then I believe it was considered a good box office . I remember there was some controversy about hidden scenes that animators put in . I am sure , I never heard of those scenes , but for a fantasy musical film , anything could be controversial in comparison , especially from disney It is amazing how animated movies used to be drawn from hand . Now computers makes the job so much easier !

What is the most difficult part ? Well it ' s hard sometimes seeing the kids with learning disabilities ( such as dyslexia ), communication disorders , emotional and behavioral disorders ( such as ADHD and ADD ). Yea , I bet . What ' s the most rewarding ? Seeing them benefit from additional educational services such as the ones I provide !

The Buffalo Bills are an interesting football team . Yeah ? I don ' t know much about them . Why are they interesting ? Well even the name is interesting as well as how they are from the Niagara Falls area . Hm , yea you would think they would call them the Niagara Buffalos or something like that . Yeah , they also come from the metropolitan area of Buffalo . okay cool . Do you know when the team first formed ? The Bills actually first began to play in 1960 . So old ! The players must be having trouble playing now ? They must be in their 70s ? Well the Bills must have different players by now because of that haha .
a food tuck is a vehicle that cooks and sells food I love food trucks , they ' re so convenient . I especially love taco trucks . Recently , food trucks have been offering more ethnic menues .

He was raised in Framlingham , Suffolk which is only 15 miles from my wifes home town . Whoa , that really is crazy . I wonder what it was like for him growing up .

It always amazes me to learn about how certain artists progress through life .
Have you ever been to Austin , Texas ? its fantastic , I have lived here all my life , What would you like to know about it ? Never been to any part of Texas , actually ! Texas just seems like a fascinating place in general . I ' d love to know anything you know off the top of your head , for starters . Well as of today Austin has a total population of 947 , 890 people making it on of the top largest cities in the US . For some reason I never thought of it as a major city . Guess I should change that thought . What ' s a fun fact about it that you like to tell people ? Well for starters it is the 11th most populated city in the USA and the 4th most populated city in Texas . Ah , pretty cool . Anything about the culture or the history that stands out Well San Antonio has a cool history , It was founded as a Spanish mission and colonial outpost way back in in 1718 , the city then became the first ever chartered civil settlement in Texas in 1731 , making it the state ' s oldest municipality .

I think blue is the best color . What color do you think is best ? I like blue as well ! I like that it contains a mix other colors , like green , azure and even a little violet . Your mention of violet reminds me of the early spring bluebells that start to bloom in early May ! Those are blue and violet for sure ! Sometimes the distant bluebells appear more blue because of an optical effect called atmospheric perspective . Does that mean when I get closer to them they appear more purple ? I ' d love to check this out . In the middle ages , blue was used in the windows of Cathedrals . I wonder if the color changed when you got closer or more distant ? You mentioned atmospheric perspective and how it can change how we see color . What else can you tell me ? You can see blue as it lies right between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light . Does the quality of light affect how I see the colors ?

Who ' s responsible for creating the Internet in the first place ? That ' s assuming that it was just one person lol . I could be wrong it takes with it a large amount of information resources and services , such as the inter - linked hypertext documents , file sharing and other similar resource Inter - linked hypertext document ?

The whole idea started as a research commissioned by the United States Federal Government in the 1960s to build robust , fault - tolerant communication via computer networks

I graduated with a BS in Nursing which takes three or four years for the course of study . Three or four years for a nursing education sure sounds exhausting Just think about medical school , which awards professional degrees for surgeons . Even more tiring ! I ' ve never considered such a career but thinking about it I can imagine it is quite tiring The highest degree is a doctorate , which usually involves research and teaching at a university . Will you ever try to get your doctorate ? would you enjoy teaching at a university ? Maybe not in nursing , but PhDs can be awarded for programs across all academic fields / What other field might you be interested in learning more about ? The history of science is interesting . Women in science have faced barriers in peer - review and lab science .
The automotive industry is such an important economic sector ! My dad worked in an automotive factory until he retired last year you know i have some relatives who work for GM and some who retired GM came about in 1908 as a holding company in Flint , Michigan , while the automotive industry itself began in the 1890s hard to believe the auto industry has been around that long I know ! And it began with the horseless carriage ! one of these days we may go back to the horseless carriage :) LOL It was once common that carriages were pulled by animals - usually horses ! i mean horse driven carriage , everything goes back to the horse even horsepower for cars The U . S . produces a lot of cars - after World War II it produced about 75 percent of the world ' s auto production .
The Inner critic in me is very intense . Everyone ' s is mine used to be crippling . I never left the house . Sometimes you have to have some self - compassion to battle those feelings in times of suffering . I try , but i just can ' t control myself most of the time . It ' s all about extending the sympathy you would have for someone else but to yourself instead . A pat on the back from myself goes a long way when I ' m down . My lack of sympathy is my biggest problem . The Greeks knew the feeling well , with " syn " meaning together and " pathos " meaning feeling . It ' s important to be sympathetic to feel a sense of community , even with yourself . I would love to be able to be part of a community , but i am to hard on people . Empathy and in general understanding others is very difficult , but it is a muscle that has to be worked to get better General understanding of others is the key for me .

Do you need to already be physically active to participate ? No , yoga is for anyone . Since the 80 ' s it has been a popular way to exercise , but you do not need to already be active to enjoy it . Are there any other benefits of yoga than spiritually ? Well you can get fit that way , or you can really center yourself by meditating . It helps you to become more flexible also .
Do you know any good role - playing games ? No but I would love to learn more about them thats where people assume roles ? Yes I think so .

I didn ' t know that tea originated in Southwest China though . I did know that however how did it become popular ?
I work in a preschool educational institute as a teacher . Does that pay well ? Not really but I enjoy the social interaction with children .

That is a pretty broad range , how do you deal with that ? Well mostly using a variety of teaching methods for each different age group .
I love to listen to religious music ! Hymns and sacred songs are something I listen to every week at Church . What is your favorite song ? I like " Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken "!

What is your view on gender changes ? I have a neutral feeling toward it . A change is the process by which a person or anmial changes its identity . I do not know how I feel , I am not sure if it makes anyone happier , at least not from research I have seen A random fact it can also occur naturally as in in the case of a sequential hermaphroditism observed in some species That is really odd , does it occur in humans ? No it does not but i did find it also sometimes happens for medical procedures What type of issues require that ? That would be very scary
I love listening to bird songs . They sound so melodious to me . I could listen all day ! I like them as well , I think the high pitch is interesting in many bird songs . I didn ' t realize that ornithologists distinguish between songs ( to do with courting and mating ) and calls which are used as alarms or keeping flocks together . Quite interesting , I thought . Yes , I ' ve heard that the distinction is mostly function based . Aldo I have heard both types being called bird vocalization . Some base their distinctions on function , e . g . the drumming of a woodpecker is considered a song . I ' d never have thought of it that way . I think some other factors that make up the distinction are complexity , length , and context of the noises . I wish I was an ornithologist and could differentiate between songs and calls !

They may accidentally pull the braces off . Happened to me . It was expensive to fix / Were your braces cosmetic or structural ? Both .

hello i would talk about child Awesome those individuals who have never had siblings are called only child of their parents . Biologically , a child ( plural : children ) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty . The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor , Yes another consideration is that some children may have half - siblings or step - siblings , either living at the same house or else where Yes there will join in same house and also they will adopted each other .

Moreso , the term bushwalking is endemic to Australia , having been adopted by the Sydney Bush Walkers club in 1927 . Oh , I see , haha ! Sorry , that name made me laugh . I don ' t think I ' ve ever heard of such a thing before . Also , New Zealand a long , vigorous walk or hike is called tramping .
I like alcohol do you ? I love it even though I haven ' t drank much yet . In chemistry its basically a hydroxyl group that binds to a saturated carbon atom . ok it means , it ' s all chemicals we are drinking right ? wow , so unhealthy ! Oh yeah chemicals are so bad haha . Thankfully Rhazes distilled alcohol for the first time way back between 854 and 925 CE , otherwise we ' d be dry haha ! Amazing , that ' s a long time along . I ' m speechless I know , it ' s crazy ! Also the "- ol " at the end is to indicate that it contains a hydroxyl functional group . chemical indeed . Do you know if there is any on going research to make alcohol safer for people to drink ?
I love pizza ! Especially fresh pizza . Frozen pizza just doesn ' t taste the same . I agree with you for the most part . I like Home Run Inn frozen pizza but that ' s the only frozen one I enjoy thus far . I ' ve never had it . Growing up , my dad used to buy us Ellio ' s Pizza . They were founded in 1963 in Long Island , NY . OK that has to be good , I ' m assuming that is fresh NY style pizza ? I used to live in Chicago and at that time I had some good Chicago style pizza . Actually , it was frozen pizza . It was " 9 slices " of pizza in a box comprising 3 rectangular pizzas , each divisible crosswise into three slices . I will still buy it from time to time just because it reminds me of my dad . I am not a fan of Chicago pizza . That sounds like it came with a bunch of pizza . I like bulk pizza like that which can feed a family . It ' s understandable that you don ' t like Chicago pizza coming from NY . What is your favorite style of pizza ? Thin crust . It ' s usually topped with additional vegetables or meats , but I prefer mine with French Fries on top . That ' s interesting , I have never had french fries on my pizza . I like supreme style with stuffed crust preferably . Ah , so I guess you prefer Pizza Hut . They debuted the stuffed crust pizza back on March 26 , 1995 .
Hi , Do you like Tupac shakur . I love that song California Love So do I ! Must be because I really like hip hop though . Me too . It also featured Dr . Dre and Roger Troutman and was released after he got out of prison in 1995 I never knew that ! I did know that the song was meant as 2Pac ' s comeback single for when he was released . Yeah , it was his first single off of Death Row records . Cool ! It is definitely one his most widely known singles too . The original version had a sample from Joe Cocker ' s song , Woman to Woman . Really ? I actually didn ' t know that , but I did know that " California Love " reached number one on the Hot 100 billboard for two whole weeks . I liked the video too . One was inspired by Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome and was Jada Pinkett ' s idea . It was really good .
I think I want to start collecting old phonograph records I think that ' d be a fine idea ! They ' re more commonly known as vinyl these days , and this usually excludes records that were made until after WWII ! I like them and think they are a cool addition to my other collections but do not know much about them Well , the way they work is they ' re an analog sound storage medium , right , and so it ' s a flat disc that has these spiral grooves that are inscribed and modulated onto the disc Oh I had no idea it was so technical please tell me what else you know about phonograph records Well this important groove that the phonograph player needle settles on to play the music , it starts near the periphery and then goes all the way to the center of the disc ! I know you have to be careful not to scratch that because it will ruin the record You ' re right ! It ' s interesting you want to collect phonographs , because since the late 1980s , digital media / compact discs took over the market share and has had it since then Well I figure they will be valuable antiques shortly
I smoke quite often from a pipe . Do you ? I used to , its the use of a pipe for smoking a substance by burning it Yup , whether that substance is tobacco or other smokeable products . Its the oldest traditonal form of smoking That makes sense , I can ' t imagine that they had bongs back then / Yea its such an old traditional form of smoking becuase of native american and such That ' s what I imagine when I think of pipe smoking as well , native americans in teepees . Yep so many native american cultures have pipe smoking in their culture Did they just smoke tobacco or other stuff too ?
Now that it is summer , do you have plans to goto the beach ? YES ! But not the ones that have man - made infrastructure , such as lifeguard posts , changing rooms , and showers . I LIKE NATURAL ! yes where it is just you , the sand and the water . Oh gosh it can be relaxing Yes ! That is why wild beaches are valued ... totally untouched beauty and preserved nature . I feel like those are slowly going to go away as real estate becomes more and more a premium . Hopefully Countries start preserving these areas for good I know ! I mean I can appreciate hospitality venues . All inclusive beaches for vacations are absolutely ideal for sure
Hi , can you tell me anything about David Mach ? I heard he was some kind of artist . Yep he is a sculptor from scotland . Interesting , what kind of sculptures does he do ? He uses mass produced objects to create works based on a flowing assemblage style . Ohh I see . Do you know where I may be able to see one of these sculptures ? A lot of his works and installations are in public spaces around Scotland . I guess I will have to try to visit some time . The pieces sound very interesting . I like how they are in public for everyone to enjoy . He typically uses things like teddy bears and newspapers for his work That sounds really cool . Using everyday items to build art intrigues me . You would never think to do something like that .
I absolutely love ice cream ! My favorite is chocolate chip mint ! Do you enjoy it ? yes it is made from dairy products such as milk and cream and is often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavors . i like ice cream but i like cookies better When was ice cream first created and by who ? im not sure about who created it or when bbut the phrase ice cream can actually mean different things in different country . it appears countries have their own word or variation for it Interesting .

Man , now I am hungry ! I really like gelato ! Isn ' t that Italian ?

We go three of four times a year . I want my daughter to try a class but she is still a little to small . The Nutcracker is a good story . I actually played " Clara " in a musical in 2nd grade . Wow , how cool . You have no interest in Dancing as an Adult ? I am a bit of a klutz . I switched over to piano lessons and Chorus . My children are exceeding me in music now . Wow , Piano impressive . I thought my self while working midnight ' s at a fancy hotel . I still prefer ballet over music . Cool . Do you have a favorite production ? Not really . I try to appreciate any one I get lucky enough to go to . Do you ?

I love spending time in the desert ! Even though it ' s a hostile environment for plants and animals , I enjoy it ! I don ' t like the heat . Then you might want to check out cold deserts ! They exist in polar regions of our planet . what are some of the popular cold desert destinations ? There are cold deserts in India adjacent to the Himalaya Mountains ! It ' s supposed to be beautiful ! That sounds really neat . I will look into it . Most people think of deserts as hot and dry , but deserts can be classified by other things such as location , amount of precipitation and temperature . Maybe the cold deserts exist because of their geographical location .
I ' ve been looking into becoming a special education teacher . I ' m doing research on what I need to get started . Good for you ! Those students need a much different approach to learning . What types of disabilities do students have who receive care from a special education teacher ? You ' d probably be working with a lot of kids who have certain behavioral disorders , like ADHD or ADD , and maybe even some developmental disabilities , like autism . It sounds like a rewarding career ! Is there a specific degree I would need to become a special education teacher ? I ' m not actually sure , but I would think so ! There are a lot of different teaching procedures and materials for special needs kids . I would imagine with the rates of autism ever increasing , special education teachers are in demand . Do you think that ' s true ? What else should I know about the profession ? Definitely ! There is always a need for special education teachers . There are other kinds of disabilities you may be working with , including kids with physical disabilities and certain learning disabilities , like dyslexia . I can ' t wait to get started helping kids ! Do you think there ' s more of a need in elementary schools , middle or high schools ?
I have been meeting with a finance advisory to help me learn about investments . Sounds interesting , Investing goes a long way of you know what your doing . Yes I know it can also be a risk at times depending on the price but thats why I want to learn to do it the right way . Learning the proper ways to invest can lead to good returns . But sometimes you must take risks . You ' re right it is about taking a risk I ' m thinking about investing in 2 out of the three categories which is public finance and personal finance . Its good to start out slow when investing to test the water so to speak before making the bigger investments . That ' s what my husband said as well he did finance for paying a debt obligations though and after doing that he got a small stock open to test it out I think I will start off investing about 500 dollars minimum . That sounds like a great plan , His experience with financing int he past will be beneficial to investing . Yes it was but he not as dedicated as me now he been into his credit rating and paying interest payments so he still kind of staying on track with finance lol .
Baseball is a bat and ball game played between two teams . Absolutely , It ' s really popular in America . It has two team with nine players each . Very true , I usually take the position of outfield , I am a better catcher than anything else . The sport makes millions from the stadiums . Yes ! There are even multi - purpose stadiums designed for different types of events ! It ' s crazy that you can actually enlist in the military at a MLB game , how rediculous . Wow ! That is interesting ! MVP baseball was a baseball game series with 5 games produced !
Did id you know that carrots probably originated in Persia ? I did not , I wonder what makes a vegetable originate from somewhere , why did it not grow everywhere at the same time ? I do not know however I know a lots of them are native to Europe and southwestern Asia . I am curious as to why they are cultivated . Me too , I wish I understood that , I suppose it has to be the climate but who knows I suppose . I think it may have to deal with globalism and adoption of mercantislism as well as needing to trade . I am not familiar with mercantilism , what does that entail ? Mercantilism is essential economic policies designed to maximize the trade of a nation and its supply of wealth . Oh okay , that makes sense , I can see how that would impact the spread of a vegetable ! Yes . It also could be said to be a small factor in trade and economic histories of counties like the United Kingdom in that era .
i recently discovered a new love for indian food I don ' t think I ' ve ever had Indian food . Can you recommend a good dish ? :) that is what I like to know since I just discovered it . I know that curry is a popular spice used in Indian cuisine ! Some curries are spiced with leaves from the curry tree ! what I do not understand , Is curry a spice or a dish ? or both ? I thought it was just a spice but apparently curry is a catch - all term that refers to a number of Indian dishes . I wonder if it ' s spicy ? it seems some dishes lack meat , is that a traditional way they prepare dishes
I love spaghetti and meatballs , what about you ? the tomato sauce and the meatballs are great That is a favorite meal around here ! We like to add some vegetables in as well like peppers and mushrooms there are tons of ways to make it , there are so many traditions of the dish , abruzzo , sicily , and other places in italy I wonder if anyone knows the original recipe to the tomato sauce , if it has changed throughout the years Tomato sauce originated in italy , but it has changed a bunch just with variations Do italians use hamburger meat for their meat balls or like sausage My family is very italian and I would say it is about even , but usually we eat sauasage as its own dish , although I am not a ahuge fan of it most of the time thats cool . we usually dont eat meatballs in ours just hamburger meat ground up , but personally i prefer the meatballs lol italians actually mock that type of meal because they serve meatballs with egg based baked pasta , which is not how we do it , weird how pretentious some people are

Jimmy Fallon is really funny . I just found out he was on SNL for six years , before moving on to star in movies . He was in Taxi and Fever Pitch . How did he get into the industry ?

As well as his television work he has two comedy albums and five books .

Not sure . I guess when the internet started , eighties

Nachos are one of the best easy , greasy foods to come from mexico And I love them so much lol . Colby Covington from the UFC kept calling his opponent Ralphie Dos Nachos and it made me want nachos . Yea they are really messy but so simple , just melted cheese and tortilla chips I feel like most Mexican dishes consists of about 5 ingredients and they are so delicious . yep , besides tortilla or cheese it was usually just meats or veggies in some different form Every time I go to my favorite Mexican restaurant I get the same thing . Four Enchiladas ! which is again just corn tortilla with meats and cheese and pepper sauce

HNS considers historical fiction as any novel written fifty years or more after the events that it is depicting .

Dust is the bane of my existence . the little fine particles of matter making me feel awful . Ugh me too ! It makes me sneeze sooooo much The worst part is the thought of dust mites and they are creepily climbing everywhere . Ewww that is so gross . What else can you tell me about dust ? Well I have asthma and unfortunately positive tests for dust mite allergies are extremely common . Oh really . So people with asthma are more likely to be allergic to dust ? Yeah mainly because of the dustmites , luckily the dust becomes heavy and settles and you can clean them up frequently . But you better wear a mask . That ' s for sure . I hate it when it gets on the ceiling fan and i have to clean that Absolutely also dust mites are a nesting species and prefer the dark and warm climates so making sure you have a lot of natural light can help prevent it and find it .
I wonder how truck drivers cope Well , I would guess that truck stops help quite a bit . No better place to rest , find a good meal , even shower nowdays ! Seriously , they are trying . Have you driven one before I have not , I had a close neighbor who drove one for many years . He liked being gone all the time though , he might be a rare case . Have you driven one ? Not at all , so scared Most drivers are responsible for their own safety as far as the truck is concerned . They are made to inspect for any issues related to safe operation .

I really love the way they drive it , it ' s so big You ' re right , some have a vehicle mass greater than 12 tonnes Wow , that ' s so big . Maybe I will get one in future

I prefer the pools , we have an Olympic - size swimming pool near us , which is the largest size they get . It ' s great for building endurance . Oh that sounds great . Do you know any exercises for helping build endurance ? Swimming and running are probably the most common , cycling is good too . I like to mix in strength training to build up my skeletal muscles , build strength , and increase my anaerobic endurance as well . Thanks for the info ! I ' m really trying to work out more , but I most days I don ' t have the motivation . It can be tough sometimes , I just think of all the benefits strength training provides like increased overall health and well - being and increased metabolism , for instance , when I need some motivation .
Do you know a lot about hockey ? I really don ' t . I know the basics . The winner is the team that scores more goals by shooting the puck into the other team ' s net . In high school many moons ago ... our ice hockey team was the best in the state . That ' s great ! Did you or any of your teammates go on to paly for the NHL or any other league ? No I doubt it . I do know a few that got full scholarships to college though . Anytime a college can recruit athletes from high schools to add good athletes to the roster is not only great for the college and team , but also helps the students a lot too . True . I give them a lot of credit to play ice hockey . I cannot even ice skate ! Haha ! I can ' t either . Anytime I have tried I have been afraid that the blades on the boots would stab me when I fell . lol I never thought of that . Great now I will think of that if I ever try again .
I only just got up - I ' m a night owl and I tend to stay up until late at night ! I used to be a night owl too , but not anymore . At what time do you go to bed ? I usually go to bed at around three in the morning - right before I go to bed is when I feel the most energetic ! Wow , that is indeed late , good think you don ' t have to wake up early . I know ! I could never be an early bird that goes to sleep early and then wakes early ! That ' s not for me ! I know at one time it was awful for me to have to wake up at seven to go to school and later to work , but I now do it willingly to go for my run . It ' s funny that in Scandinavia early birds and night owls are called A - people and B - people LOL That is funny indeed . Of course there are still times when I what to sleep late but for me now late is 9am . Maybe I have a delayed sleep - phase disorder - that ' s one explanation for being a night owl

Family Guy is one of my favorite cartoons . It ' s an american cartoon created by Seth McFarlene shown on Fox . I have seen a few episodes but my family thought it was too offensive to watch Yes , it can be . The creator actually made it after making two animated films " The Life of Larry " and " Larry & Steve ". I have never heard of those , family guy must be the best one ! Me either . The show has such dark humor , though , that it is has received a lot of backlash from the organizations like the Parents ' Television Council . That makes sense , it does seem a bit offensive in my opinion , but some people love that Yes , but is what the show is known for : offensive jokes , violence , disturbing images , and gore . That is true , like I said , to each their own , but it is not my thing ! Yes , I guess it ' s not for everyone ' s taste ! Fox even cancelled it in Season 3 with one unaired episode left . Adults Swim then picked it up and aired the episode and finished the run .
Hi ! I am a soccer player , do you like soccer ? Interesting , I am not a soccer player , but I cannot help but be a fan along with 250 million soccer players around the world with the World Cup going on . That is a lot of fans ! I was watching one game for the World Cup on Sunday . How many are left ? The World Cup , put on by the International Federation of Association Football ( or FIFA ), has many games left this cycle . We still have 18 more group matches before elimination play . thats crazy ! Didn ' t realize how much of a lengthy process it was ! Who won the world cup last year The last FIFA World Cup was played in 2014 with Germany being crowned the winners . Ohh I thought it was an every year thing . So it happens every 4 years ?
Back pain is excruciating . It can be in any region in the back . I have really bad lower back pain from a hammock accident . The lumbar is the most common area which pain can occur . It also supports most of the body weight . Can backs have successful surgery ? The dull may be a dull ache , shooting pain or a pain that is piercing or burning feeling . In the lumbar ? There are internal structures such as pancreas , aorta , kidneys and gallbladder may also experience locations for back pain .
Who is your favorite Flinstones character ? I think it is DIno ! The Flintstones is an American animated sitcom Dino is a great pet . I thought it was silly that Barney and Betty had a hopparoo pet . It is just a great show ! The series takes place in a romanticized Stone Age setting Did you know that Fred works at a rock quarry ? What a fun place that must be . Yeah it is neat ! It was originally broadcast from September 30 , 1960 . That ' s way before I was born , but I still watched it all through my childhood into my teen years . What did you think of Fred ' s car ? I always though it was really funny , The continuing popularity of " The Flintstones " rested heavily on its juxtaposition I always thought Pebbles and Bam Bam were annoying .
I only ever shop at Walmart . I don ' t think a human ever needs to go anywhere else for anything . Don ' t you agree ? Walmart has been criticized by labor unions Oh no ! Have I been wrong all of this time ? I always thought it was the greatest company on earth . This is so disappointing ! Where can I shop instead ? There are places like Costco , Sam ' s Club , Publix , Foodlion , and Aldi ' s Do they have a better track record with how they treat their employees ? I do have a Sam ' s Club membership but aren ' t they owned by Walmart ? I would not reccomend Sam ' s Club I just gave it as an option , but Aldi ' s is a brad in over 18 countries . I have one of those Near me . I can ' t believe they are that big a company . Where was Aldi ' s started ? It was started in Germany in 1964 by brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht . I wonder where the name Aldi ' s came from it isn ' t there last name . Is it just a grocery store ?
I like to listen to Katy Perry . She is an American singer born in 1984 . I love her music ! She has so many great songs ! Yeah , she got started singing in church during childhood . She sang gospel as a teenager . That ' s cool ! I would never have thought of her as a gospel singer . Her name was Kate Hudson but adopted her stage name " Katy Perry " for her first successful album in 2007 . That would make sense . Isn ' t Kate Huson an actress or model ? Yeah , that ' s probably one of the reasons she changed it . She became famous in 2008 when her 2nd album was released containing " Hot n Cold " and " I Kissed a Girl ". I also really like her song Eye of the Tiger too ! That ' s a good one too . Some of her other hits are " California Gurls " and " Firework ".
I absolutely loved The Little Mermaid as a child ! It came out in 1989 , a year after I was born ! I enjoyed that movie very much . What was your favorite thing about the film ? I like how beautiful Ariel was , and her dream of becoming human was sweet . Are you a fan of animated movies , in general , or was it just this one ? I like all of the Disney Renaissance movies . That was an era where Disney movies thrived . Beauty and The Beast was another one part of that era . I loved that one , too . Mrs . Potts and her little teacup kid , Chip , were my favorites in that movie . I love the music in these movies , too . How about you ? Yes ! I love the music too . But for some reason , the Little Mermaid had the best soundtrack to me . Part of Your World was a great song ! Oh , yes ! I still like Under the Sea , though . I like the reggae - ness of it . LOL ! I love that one too ! Part of Your World stuck out to me because it expresses Ariel ' s strong desire to become human .
Florida is such a diverse state with so many climates It really is . I want to visit . Florida is actually Spanish for land of flowers oh how interesting ! Are there lots of different flowers there I wonder There was a spanish explorer that visited in 1513 . I think that ' s who gave it the name but I ' m not certain Maybe there was a lot of flowers compared to where he came from thats why he used that name , there are a lot of tropicals there I can imagine . It ' s the only state that borders the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean . With its placement it ' s perfect for it I would love to go but I am not into all of the tourism , would love a secluded beach part to go to Miami is the most populated urban area but I ' ve heard of a lot of beaches that are calm compared to there . Just have to look around
HI there , im a juggler . Do you Juggle ? I do not but always wanted to . I just learned that the words " juggling " and " juggler " derive from the Middle English " jogelen " (" to entertain by performing tricks "), which in turn is from the Old French " jangler ". How cool , can you tell me more about the origin ? Sure can . It goes back to the 11th century . Interesting , I wonder why people began juggling in the first place . Many reasons I ' m sure . Recreation , entertainment , art or sport . That makes sense . It is very fun ! You ' ve done it ? I think it would be fun to juggle knives , fire torches or chainsaws . I have ! Never knives or anything like that ! Don ' t you think that is dangerous ?
I have two dogs ! They ' re both pugs . Do you like dogs ? Yes I like dogs . We just got a puppy a few weeks ago . Pugs are so cute with the wrinkly face . What kind of puppy did you get ? We are not exactly sure yet ... he is part hound , and a mix . We are thinking he might be a jack Russel . Is your pug social and gentle ? Pugs are very social and gentle . And funny ! They ' re known as clown dogs . Queen Victoria had a passion for pugs , in the united kingdom . Really ? I didn ' t know that ! I knew they were originally a part of Chinese Royalty . Yes . Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the 16th century . They used to be royal foot warmers ! I can see why , mine sit on my feet all the time !
ive had an xbox for 10 years now , its really cool ! do you play the xbox , are you curious about it like I am ? We have an Xbox 360 and an Xbox one but we hardly play them . Yea I remember when the The Xbox 360 came out , It was a fantastic developed by Microsoft . I play mine all the time . The only thing I hate about Xbox is having to pay for Xbox live . Well it is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service with free monthly games , So I guess it has to cost some money to run the service . Yes , But you have to pay for xbox live just to be able to watch Netflix on your system . Playstation doesn ' t charge for that . Thats wild and to think that thing sold over 24 million units sold , People really got it for the games though and didnt care at that time about netflix ect . But yeah I agree paying to watch netlfix is so dumb . I think XBoxis more popular because the graphics and games are better . Yea but when the xbox came to the United States in November 2001 , No one really cared about graphics all too much , they just wanted fun games , the original Xbox console had similar graphics to PS2 and some better in most cases .
My favorite city is New York . New York City is the best ! I love the fast pace ! I wish I could go visit for a " New York minute " or two ! Oh , so that ' s why they say that . What is the population of New York City ? 8 . 5 million people if you can believe it ! That ' s 40 % of the population of the entire state ! I love how diverse the city is , don ' t you ?

I have a friend that seems to be having some emotional issues with finding out that her brother has cancer . I wonder if seeing a psychologist would help ? I am so sorry to hear about your friend . I do think that is a good decision seeing that mental health is a psychologists area of expertise . Yes , I feel really bad for her , and I believe it is a kind that runs in the family , and the doctor said the siblings should check for themselves . She is really troubled by it , a psychologist may help with that part . Wow , that sounds very intense but psychologists are trained for this and can help her to improve her mental health whilst going through this rough time . they can also evaluate and come up with solutions for the entire family as well It sounds like she should definitely check into it . We live in a small town and I ' m not sure how much availability there is for a psychologists , but I think it would be helpful . I am sure she can find some more info online . But it will be a good thing if she can get evaluated so as to nip any mental disorder in the bud that may be exasperated by this event . Yes , traumatic events can sometimes elevate any underlying issues . I had a close person that was bipolar and they never sought help from a psychologist and they struggled so much , I think it would have helped them .
Do you remember the show Friends ? I could never forget it , it ran ten seasons in the late 90s , right in my childhood years . Those guy were hilarious . I never missed an episode . It certainly had a talented cast , with people like Jennifer Aniston , Matt Perry , and Lisa Kudrow among others . Jennifer Aniston was my favorite . She is still nowadays but I feel in love with her watching Friends She ' s a great actress for sure . It ' s hard to imagine the show was originally titled Insomnia Cafe , it sounds so out of place .

I love dogs . I have always had one as a pet . I have always loved dogs , i have had a couple , a labrador is my favorite breed , they are part of the wolf - like canids I ' ve never owned a lab . I have mostly owned cocker spaniels . They are nice too , dog was the first species to be domesticated and bred for over a millennia ! Really ? I thought maybe it was cats . No , it was dogs actually . Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior , cats came from ancient Egypt i think Yes , I was thinking of Cleopatra times when it came to cats . Me too , they were protected in egypt , dogs vary widely in shape , size and colors , but they all came from wolves , crazy right ? Yes but I can definitely see the resemblence .

Coca Cola is the traditional drink used in rum and coke , while bacardi is the alchol I don ' t usually drink . Although , I do like hard apple ciders . If you like hard apple ciders , you have to try rum and coke with Coca0cola orange . It has a more citrus taste . Oh I ' ve never heard of that . That does sound delicious ! Ya rum and coke may be made with any type of rum or cola . Often lime juice is even included . Citrus tastes in rum and coke are great Would coconut taste good with a rum and coke ? I would suppose so . Coconut has a smooth taste too . I may even be so bold as to say using a little pina colada cocktail could really brighten the drink . That sounds really amazing ! I think I might have to try one ! Little known fact about coconuts is that it used to be spelled cocoanut ?

I just recently started reading the series called Wheel of Time . It ' s very good so far . I ' m not familiar with it , is it a work that allows you to explore the text deeply in your interpretations ? That ' s one of the great benefits of having no concrete laws in reading .

I didn ' t know that either . It must have really stained when they spilled it ! LOL I would imagine so , even more then now . I guess they do not use it anymore in modern wines but I am not sure Yeah , I don ' t think modern wines are adulterated with anything to color . Red wine gets its color from the skins of the grapes .

I really love the color blue So do I ! It ' s one of the three primary colors . Along with red and yellow , yes -- but blue is the best :) Agreed ! It also lies just between the colors violet and green on the visible spectrum . There ' s nothing like a clear blue sky to cheer the soul Yup , it ' s weird to think that this is all due to the wavelength of the light , which would be between 450 and 495 nanometres for the color blue . I wonder why when people feel sad , that they say they feel ' blue '. I really don ' t know , perhaps it has some association with how prevalent the color blue has been in decoration and art even back in ancient times . But there ' s nothing about the color that makes me feel depressed .

They also explained the different types of vegan to me - ie dietary vegans and ethical vegans . I think I ' m a dietary one I suppose . What does an ethical vegan do that differs ? The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives , and oppose the use of animals for any purpose . There are lots of vegan festivals throughout the world every year ' veganfest ', you should check if there are any near you . That sounds like a great idea and a opportune way to meet other vegans . where is the veganfest held and when ? Aparently they are in all different countries around the world .

Are you considering on becoming a vegan as you know a lot about it ?
So sad to see that Stephen Hawking died It was truly a tragedy , especially with how he overcame the odds and lived way longer despite his disease . yep he lived for over 70 years when they thought hed die at 20 , born 1942 . Stephen hawking was amazign Wow , I knew he was supposed to die much earlier , but a whole 50 additional years ? That ' s incredible . He was one of the most important physicist and cosmologist of our time A lot of this must be attributed with how popular and well known he became , right ?

I know we ' re not in a recession or in an era of high unemployment , but I ' m still looking for a job . What kind of job are you currently in the market for , anything particular ? Anything at the moment would be helpful . My old job was taken away by automation and global competition . That is always terrible when you lose your job under those conditions , it would be so much easier to accept if it was a fault of your own . On top of the number of workers that were laid off along with me , another issue is the lower wage levels for similar jobs . That is very true , so many people put in such harder work than is reflected by their pay and it is incredibly unfair . How can a crisis like this even be confronted ? I ' d just be happy with a simple living wage , something that can help me meet my basic needs .
Thinking about certain things to mature in in college . I live in the midwest and agriculture is a possible major . Still not sure if it ' s right for me , though . Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of plants and animals for food and other uses . Important field . Right , I have the gist of that down . Are there any nuts and bolts of it you can convey ? It was the key development for the rise of sedentary human civilization . Farming allowed us to remain in one place . That makes a lot of sense , I suppose . No need to roam for your food and pick up where you ' re living . What do you think I should know if I ' m thinking about choosing it as a life path ? The study of agriculture is called agricultural science . You can become a scientist or maybe a farmer . I guess there are more options available than I knew I had . An agricultural scientist , eh ? What ' s one thing you want to leave me considering ?

i love hard shell tacos ! Not me I prefer soft ! I love that you can eat it on the go like on roadtrips without a hassle . Unless the avocado , tomatoes , onion , lettuce and cheese start falling out ! i hate that ! Tacos predate the Europeans in Mexico and were discovered to be the food of choice by the indigenous folk in the Valley of Mexico . I was surprised to learn that most taco shells are wheat ! I thought not because it wasn ' t brown . oh i thought they were mostly corn ? i should check out , “ Taquería ”, is a Spanish word meaning taco shop , and ask them . We are both right ! It is 50 / 50 on corn or wheat but I thought it was all wheat until I went shopping the other day . Also I cannot stand the brands , inc TACO BELL , you ? me neither , i mostly just hate the fact that they raise cows just to be killed .

I have a Hot pink moped . I ' ve always wanted to have moped , because I could use it as bike and when I didn ' t feel like pedaling , I would use the engine . It is kinda slow but faster than a bike . That probably explains why you don ' t have to have a driver license to operate one . True . They are great for shop hops in the city . Its still better than an electronic bike because governments are enacting laws after their popularity . They would rather support a fossil fuel vehicle than a green one . It appears so , United States and Canada have federal regulations governing the safety requirements and standards of manufacture . Makes me wonder who is padding the coffers .

I ' m currently exercising and trying to lose weight . When you intentionally try to lose weight , it is sometimes referred to as slimming . I ' ve heard that . I went through a period of actively losing weight a year or two ago , I lost 40 pounds . How are you doing ? Well I ' ve been actively exercising for 6 weeks and I haven ' t lost a thing . Since weight loss occurs when the body expends more energy then it takes in , I must be still overeating . That ' s a likely possibility . I had to seriously pay attention to my intake , calorie counting a lot . Do you use any tools like apps or anything to help ? No , Instead of restricting the amount of calories I take in , I ' ve just been trying to stay away from sugars and starches .

Yes , sometimes I emotionally eat . It ' s when you overeat to combat negative feelings .

Yes and it has an amazing unification power especially when your favorite teams are playing Yes , I like how all countries playing football are governed by the same body - FIFA - and can participate in a tournament such as the world cup . Technology is playing alot of role these days . I like how the fouls are double checked on the computer if the referee is not sure before he awards This can be very helpful in stopping any issues - like in the 2006 world cup with all of the controversy around referee decisions . Technology can help alleviate the burden on the referees but also make it fairer for all . I things get better because I love the game

They must be a very strong team then . Do you know what club has won more ?
I love Austin Texas . It is a the capital of the state and is in Travis County Oh yeah I have been there for the SXSW I love all of the music and culture in the city . It is actually considered to be the Live music capital of the world ! They have a slogan " Keep Austin Weird " The place has it all . I especially like all the lakes and rivers in the area , like Lady Bird Lake and Barton Springs Austin has the worst traffic in the whole state Well it is the 11th most populated city in the U .

Armidillos are new world mammals in the order of cingulata and have a leathery armour shell . I remember seeing one when I visited texas and I bought a stuffed animal of one . It was cute The word armadillo is known to mean little armoured one in Spanish . Oh thats really interesting , are they from that area , or are they located in the mexico / lower US area , and thats where the spanish name comes from ?

Airplanes come in many sizes , shapes , and wing configurations . Yes , I suppose that is true . I prefer bigger planes when I fly . The small ones make me nervous . Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily I don ' t like to fly , although I ' ve been flying since I was a child . I still don ' t care for it . It scares me a bit . I would guess there has been some fear since The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903 I think they have done a lot to alleviate fears since then though ! Perhaps . Many airplanes are designed to be remotely or computer - controlled these days .
My son joined Boy Scouts and I have volunteered to help the troop . I am new to Boy Scouts . That ' s pretty cool !

Their goal is to train youth in responisble citizenship and character development My son needs that ! I have looked at the training materials , and it appears that i will need to put about 30 hours a week into this project . After work i am tired . i ' m not sure i can commit to this . Have you ever thought about getting an au pair ? Au pair is a nanny / helper from a different country who will live with you and could help you with your son and other stuff We had one , but my wife hated her . I thought she was great . My wife said the au pair had to go or she was . I think i made the wrong choice . Maybe i will enroll my son in Karate classes . That is only one hour a week . Maybe instead of au pair you could find a nanny . She could take him to karate or boy scouts events and provide a child care
I used to play a lot of Halo . I always thought the Master Chief to be an intriguing character . I didn ' t care for halo , but my wife loved it . Once 343 industries took over from Bungie with Halo 4 , I think it lost its magic . I ' m not surprised . That happens to a lot of games . Do you know Cortana ? The artificial intelligence from Halo . Yeah , I remember her . I always liked the unusual relationship between Cortana and the Master Chief . It added a strange bit of company to the misery of lonliness that the story sometimes creates . It was a true story for the ages . Maybe . The faceless character of the Master Chief allows the player to embody the character . It is a powerful story - telling device .
I ' ve always wanted to know the history of Japan . My grandmother was from there , but died before I was born , so I never got to hear any stories .

The imperial dynasty reigns over Japan today I didn ' t realize they had a government that was run by a dynasty . So Japan ' s government like England with a Monarchy ? Well , the Emperor of Japan is the only head of state with the title Emperor . I see . Thanks to you I ' ve learned already . Japan also seems to be a huge technology mecca .

Anything else you could tell me about the production of the movie , or the plot , etc .? The original screenplay was rewritten several times in an attempt to shorten the film . The film ended up still being over 3 hours long Oh , that ' s good to know , since that ' s so long . Interesting . What else do you know about it ? The film was delayed for over two years because the producer was determined to have Gable star in it
I love pizza ! It ' s my FAVORITE food . Favorite favorite ? even with anchovies ? I ' d eat it even with anchovies , that ' s how I love it . I even know about history of pizza . It actually began in antiquity . in antiquity ? like from poor ? Sort of , the term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century , in some Latin manuscript . Of course it comes from Italy , first found in the town Gaeta in Lazio . how long till it moved to the rest of the world ? In 2009 , Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union . It was said to be a Traditional Specialty dish at first . very nice ! But the original pizza wasn ' t exactly the same as nowadays . The original one was a focaccia , a flat bread with toppings .
do you like star trek ? it ' s science fiction tv series I love star trek and grew up watching it i can ' t believe the first star trel debuted in 1966 I remember when it debuted and it was different from anything on television at that time i wasn ' t even born :) I love all the interstellar adventures of Captain James Kirk Dr . McCoy and Mr . Spock were my favorite characters , never really cared for Kirk really ? why ? he is awesome he leads his crew as they explore new worlds I think it was the actor William Shatner that I never really cared for but the rest of the cast was great ok , i understand . as for me , he is such a talented actor and producer and director as well
A cup cake is also known as petty cake I have never heard of that before . In the UK a similar cake is referred to as a Fairy Cake . Cup cake is designed to serve one person Well , they ' re not very big , but they are very tasty ! As with larger cakes , icing and other cake decorations such as fruits and candy can be applied I like icing on mine . Fruit would be nice as well , but I don ' t know about candy . Cup cakes originated since 1796
I love to read - it ' s such a great escape - do you ? I completely agree . Reading is such a fun , enjoyable thing to do . It also is nice in that it helps share information and ideas . This will help progress our society so that we can learn from our mistakes . What is your favorite type of book ? I love mysteries , but have gotten into some Christian romance fiction lately also . That is a good genre . Have you read inspirational fiction ? It helps inspire people . Many libraries are classifying it in it ' s own genre .. Yes a few of them as well . Karen Kingsbury is probably my favorite author of that genre . Her first book " Missy ' s Murder " is a favorite of mine . I can ' t believe that it was written all the way back in 1991 . Do you know about the murder story that it was based on ? I don ' t think I ' ve read that one as our library leaves a bit to be desired in this area . Ahh you should defintely check for it . Libraries should provide a place for creativity and analyzing things critically . All people should give reading a chance .. I completely agree - and I love watching my girls just devour books now also
A lot of teenagers get pregnant these days , it is also known as adolescent pregnancy that occurs in females under 20 years old Why do you think it happens more frequently nowadays ? I think their upbringing is the major cause , maybe the parents that raised them didnt play their role well I feel sorry for the young kids as the parents at that age most times are not mature enough . Is there any programs out there trying help educate these young individuals ? i think there a lot of foundations and programs educating teenagers on teenaage education Is the rate higher in depending on the demographics ? yes i think it is , but Teenage pregnancy in developed countries is usually outside of marriage , and carries a social stigma in many cultures and groups That must be awful for the teens . Which country has the highest rate of teen pregnancy ? i think America has the highest rate because according to research conducted In 2014 , 249 , 078 babies were born to women between 15 - 19 years old I ' m amazed by that . I thought it would be a developed country . Do most of these teens end up losing their kids or having them adopted ?
I am more of a short stay traveler , just a few days here and there . How about you ? Actually I haven ' t had the opportunity to travel very often . What ' s it all about ?

I always love to surf , since I was a teenager . I do not know if I would be brave enough to try it , but it looks really neat . The best Waves suitable for surfing are found in the ocean , but lakes also are a good place . I have never seen someone surf in a lake , only the ocean . You also can utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools . Okay , that makes sense . Maybe a wave pool would be a good place to try it out . There are no sharks in there ! Or you can try body boarding . It consits of riding wave on a bodyboard , either lying on their belly , drop knee , or sometimes even standing up on a body board .

Its a great piece of technology . I like using the GPS .

i love baking cakes , its so much fun . I never learned how to bake , but my mom sure is great at it , her cakes and cookies are the best ! what ' s your favorite ? mine is chocolate , but you need to use fresh cocoa I like chocolate and then plain old yellow cake . I do not like frosting though actually , I find it to be nasty i love frosting , but only on vanilla cake not chocolate I will take the frosting off of the cake usually , I am very picky about it . When was the first cake made ? probably bake when bread was first invented , someone just like sweet bread and bam ! cake ! Haha , most likely . I think I like cupcakes the most because I can eat them in one bite typically and they have frosting less often I love cupcakes , cupcakes are the best cakes .
The Beatles were so famous . Are you a fan of their music ? Not really , but I know they are widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band .

In reply , God made the lion sneeze , and out popped a cat . And there are over 70 breeds of cats according to various registries ! Many Egyptians worshipped the goddess Bast , who had a woman ’ s body and a cat ’ s head , that is interesting . It is interesting ! And cats can see in near darkness . Yes , I know that . The Egyptian Mau is probably the oldest breed of cat . In fact , the breed is so ancient that its name is the Egyptian word for “ cat .”
I used to work at a pizza joint . Did you ever do that too ? No , I never did , but always found it fascinating the way they throw the dough in the air . Pizza is one of the most popular foods in the world ! Many different places have their own semi - unique way of making it Do you know where it originated from ? Yup ! Pizza was invented in Naples Nice . I really like thin crust pizza . Oh I do too . It gives it more crunch . It ' s usually sold fresh or frozen Yes .

I visited it about 15 years ago It had about 7 . 3 million visitors all over the world in 2016 .
I love me some Coca - Cola ! My favorite soft - drink It ' s my favorite too , though I prefer Diet Pepsi over Diet Coke . That ' s known as " Brad ' s Drink ", well first introduced . Pepsi has a cool story that is Oh yeah , it ' s so weird to think of how old these soft drinks are in origin ! Can you believe the original ingredient of coke is kola nuts and coca leaves ? Now that ' s nuts ! Not at all , they have really changed the recipe to be more manufacturable , like with high fructose corn syrup . I would drink their concentrate by the tap ! Hey , was that cocaine plant that was once in it ? Yeah I ' m pretty sure they had cocaine or at least the plant in it , which is how it got its name right ? Wow ! That floors me . And people say it isn ' t healthy but I don ' t mind high fructos corn syrup . I don ' t drink it often so it ' s ok
I am a Christian , and I believe that God does exist ! There are a lot of arguments for and against the existence of God . I don ' t consider myself a Christian , but I do believe there is a God . I feel that , if one has at least some type of belief concerning a higher power , regardless of the details , that it ' s all that really matters .

Now I find that real surprising as well , huh , I too thought it would be more ! It ' s still considered the world ' s largest religion . Well my friend , I thank you for educating me further on these unknown facts !

Yes there are over 100 types . Unfortunately for my friend , hers wasn ' t really caused by anything she did . Was your grandmother a tobacco user ? Yes , she was . Smoked for years even though she was a nurse . I think its more scary when you dont have a trigger . Definitely more scary . Tobacco is no joke though . It causes 22 % of cancer deaths and is responsible for 85 % of lung cancer . I hope you do not smoke ! Absolutely not ! Not after seeing her decline . I am glad to hear that :) I think the next biggest causes of cancer are obesity , infections , radiation and environmental pollutants . Environmental , like power lines and polluted water ?
I wish that I was better with sewing . I am just terrible at attching things with stitches I am not good at it either . I would love to be able to . I ' m thinking of getting a sewing machine . The machine can probably attach the material with thread better than me . It would be nice to be able to repair my own clothing . Yes , and using a modern sewing machine and the automated process of stitching would save so much time . Very much a time saver , but using a sewing machine requires a little bit of skill too . Yes , but it shouldn ' t be too difficult . THey are designed for one person to be able to use them . That is true . I guess it just take a little bit of time to figure it out .
Have you heard of the band Tool . They ' re one of my favorites . Awesome ! I don ' t know if you already knew but they are an American rock band from Los Angeles , California . They ' ve won three Grammy Awards and have had several world wide tours . Wow , you really are a fan of Tool ! I think my favorite album by them is " Undertow " which really made them a dominant act in the alternative metal movement act . They are different and part of progressive rock , art rock , or psychedelic rock I feel like Tool was never the same after they replaced their original bassist Paul D ' Amour with Justin Chancellor in 1995 . They originally signed with Zoo entertainment back in the eighties Yeah , I definitely remember that . Man , can Danny Carey play those drums , he makes the band come alive sometimes . He really carried the band in the songs " Cold and Ugly ", " Hush ", and " Part of Me ". They toured with a lot of good bands too . The Rollins Band , Rage Against the Machine , White Zombie .

That ' s cool , I ' ve heard oranges are really crucial to Florida ' s economy , does that sound right to you ? I hadn ' t heard that ! They do have the perfect climate for oranges , as it varies from subtropical in the north to tropical in the south That makes sense , the Florida climate does seem very good for growing stuff , Do you know anything about Miami ? I was thinking of going there . I know that Miami is an urban area , and is the most populous of the urban areas in Florida Interesting , I didn ' t know it had so many people . I think I heard that Miami had the highest rated air quality back in like 2008 . Awesome ! Interestingly , the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean has a peninsula of which Florida occupies about two - thirds That ' s neat , I wonder what the southern most part of Florida is , maybe the Florida Keys ?

i want to learn to surf , but waves that are suitable for surfing are only found in the ocean and will have to travel to one I would love to learn how to surf I also would love to live by a ocean surfing actually started with the polynesians really I guess thats why people in Hawaii can really surf i would assume so , in hawaiian language the art of surfing " heʻe ʻana " (" heʻe " means " to surf " yes I was recently in Hawaii an I Saw that hanging on the wall in dukes restaurant the part of surfing that scares me is actually standing up on the board which the polynesians invented its hard especially when you talk about riding a wave but windsurfing also looks cool , its where you combine surfing and sailing
I used to smoke two packs a day . Wow , that ' s a lot of smokes in a day ! Once , I almost got Carbon monoxide poising from smoking too much I ' m glad you got through this , I can just imagine how much you have passed through Yes with all the negative effects smoke has on our health , I am lucky I was able to stop . I used to smoke as well but then I stopped when my father got lung cancer and he died Very true , thats why a lot of countries have smoking bans that prevent people getting second hand smoke I even read about a second hand smoker who got cancer . So , it ' s a win when a government takes initiative to reduce smoking in a country That is tragic , I heard that as well that tobacco smoke causes disease , disability and death .
I ' m not that afraid of heights , but so many people in my family are . I have acrophobia myself , i hate heights so much How high up do you have to be to start hating it ? Acrophobia for me is either not wanting to fall or being really high up , so I hate unsturdy ladders and i height sturdy airplanes I got you , I ' m not a huge fan of the ascent in an airplane either . Yea acrophobia doesnt play much into most aspects of life but heights are horrid when i have to face them That seems to be the case for a lot of fears , like claustrophobia . Yea things like acrophobia are common since heights are dangerous That ' s a fair reason , since it makes a lot of sense to be afraid of something so potentially dangerous .
I ' m thinking of getting job working at a hospital . Do you have any experience with that ? Yeah ! The most known type is the general hospital which has an emergency department . I guess that would be the best place to apply , as they probably have the most openings . It must be hectic working in an emergency room though , right ? Well , specialized hospitals are available to potentially reduce healthcare costs . I wish our healthcare costs would go down , but I don ' t see it happening . Do you think that pay is generally better in general or specialized hospitals ? A district hospital is usually the biggest one in its region , with vast amount of beds for intensive care and long term care . I ' ve never even heard of a district hospital . Maybe I would like that better as I could spend more time getting to know the patients . Plus , a teaching hospital includes medical students and nurses . I don ' t think that would interest me . Which do you have experience with ?
Whittling is a lot of fun and quite relaxing to just be carving wood . I have never done it myself but I appreciate the skill involved I ' ve done it a few times .

It is like dressing up at Halloween or other special events ? The dressing up portion is like Halloween . It started in the 1920 ' s as a form of therapy . It ' s live action role playing games which people are specific characters and have specific roles . It is interesting to learn about it . I didn ' t heard of it before . What kind of therapy is it ? What was the reason behind it ? The first LARPS began in the late 1970 ' s which were inspired by fictional tales and table games . I see . I will probably be looking more into it . I do enjoy Halloween a lot . How did you hear about this . Is this a well known thing ? I actually watch a documentary on the subject . They have rules and guidelines too . You have to abide by these rules in order to play the game .
Do you read the newspaper ? I do occasionally , but just don ' t think about it with the computer and all Newspapers are important instutions . I believe we have to support them if we want any sort of investigative journalism . that makes sense , there would be no need for journalism without newspapers , I am sure they have been around for decades YEah some even so trusted enough to become the " Newspapers of Record " which means their journalism is trusted enough to be consensus fact . Wow , that is interesting , do investigative journalists earn a lot every year ? They can make about $ 45 , 000 a year , definitely more that the aforementioned " Newspapers of Record " like The New York Times and Boston Globe and such . That is not bad pay at all , do they require any special training or schooling ? Oh yeah you gotta go to one of the premier journalism schools , to learn how to cover things like politics and business , even weather . Oh well that does make sense , the weather guy .. what is the terminology for them again ? I forgot they go to school to do that , it would be hard to learn all the words and phrases they use

I had always thought it originated in China . Oh no it was from Japan . Even in WW II when the military was stationed in Okinawa , karate was popular there among the men . It goes back quite a long way . It is good for the mental well being also . Oh definitely . The movies that came out in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s helped to increase the popularity of it around the world . It sure is popular . There are over 4 Karate studios in my town alone . Yup , I wouldn ' t doubt it . There are schools all over the place . They usually interest those that have a somewhat interest in it to a deeper connection with the art . I might let my son learn how to take it one day . I think he would be good at it .
I give lessons on string instruments ! Particularly , the violin ! The wooden string instrument . Have you ever played it ? I have not . I am not the most musical person in the world . I did used to take piano lessons Violin is a lot of fun ! It has a nice hollow wooden body , and produces a pleasant sound . I do enjoy the sound of string instruments . I have always wanted to learn how to play guitar Yeah ? The electric guitar or acoustic ? I play the six stringed acoustic . I would probably play acoustic if I chose to take lessons Cool , it ' s not hard to learn . There are plenty of good YouTube tutorials also . The violin is interesting because it ' s the smallest and highest pitch instrument in its family .
Do you like chickens ? they are cute but they taste good too ! Lol indeed they do ! I have some males , they are less than a year old , They are called " cockerels ". do you really ? What do you raise them for ? We do so because they are such a common and widespread animal and they make us eggs too , They have a total population of more than 19 billion as of 2011 worldwide , Pretty wild right ? . That is really crazy , that is almost triple our population ! Indeed , It blows my mind too every time I think about it , chickens are such an important animal for both agriculture and human survival . that is true , I wonder how we managed to get them to grow in such numbers though , that is astounding Its because we have more than 50 billion chickens that are raised annually on farms as a source of food , for both their meat and their eggs . oh wow , so the surviving population is low in comparison , that is a lot of food we eat !
I love to eat broccoli . Can you tell me more about this vegetable ? Broccoli is an edible green plant in the cabbage family Interesting , I always think they look like miniature trees .

What else can you tell me ? Its classified as Italica cultivar group of the species " Brassica oleracea ". Ohh that is so cool . I guess there are many kinds of broccoli huh . We have three commonly grown types of broccoli . I see . They are all edible , yes ? Do they all look the same ?
I always thought I was a dog person , until I met Ollie the ginger tom . I fell totally in love ! Same here i am a big cat person , the domestic cat felis is a small , typically furry mammal Nothing small about Ollie - he ' s a big boy . He acts like a dog , following his owner around the fields all day ! Thats very interesting , another fact about them is that they are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets My neighbor has two such cats - they ' ve never even been out on her porch . What a weird lifestyle , don ' t you think ?! Yeah thats very weird ! Another fact is that they are often valued by humans for companionship I can see why humans like cats for companionship - they can be very loving .

I did not know that . I know it has been on for a few years now , I saw the first few episodes anf thought it was a little too risque for me Yes , I believe it is quite risque which probably explains why it is so popular in today ' s society ! lol That is true , we love having a good excuse to indulge ourselves suppose The actors on A Game of Thrones are also quite attractive which also explains why so many people tune in to view .
I ' ve had horrible morning sickness . It was vomiting during pregnancy . O no ! Im sorry to hear that . Me and the girlfriend are about to start trying for a baby . Aww ! Well I hope she does not get it . If she does , it will typically happen between the 4th and 20th week . I will keep that in mind , Do you have any tips for her ? Definitely start her on some prenatal vitamins now . Takin them before may decrease the risk . I will make sure to get some of those . There is also evidence that ginger may help . I might try to make her some ginger tea if she gets sick That would be nice . Even with all the studies down , it is still unknown what causes the sickness .

Yes it was The Shining was made in 1980 , three years after the book was published . I ' ve heard Stephen King hated the movie .
I love french fries , do you ? I love them , but think of them as a salt delivery system . I love salt more . Why do you like them so much ? Because I love potatoes and anything fried . Do you remember when Americans called them Freedom Fries ? Yes , in France they call them batonnet . I ' m surprised the French would even eat them . Their diet is usually so healthy .

Yeah those are great ! they are similar to llamas and are often confused with them until you try to eat them ! Yeah do they spit > i dont know about that , but they are closely related and are even cross - bred now I wonder how long they have been around ? probably since jesus was around , they are usually kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the andes of southern peru , western bolivia , and ecuador Wow you really taught me something today
My new obsession is cross country running . I love running out in nature and dirt trails . Cross country running is fun , but can be challenging . The courses are long and include varied surfaces and include hills . Yes , it is quite a challenge . I ' m training to compete , which most competitions take place in fall and winter , but worried about running when it rains or snows . That will be even more of a challenge . Oh sure , running in sleet or snow or hail would be awful ! A course can be from 2 1 / 2 to 7 1 / 2 miles long . My farthest has been 3 miles so far . Formal competitions go back to a 19th century English game called " hare and hound " or " the paper chase " Is that why the runners are sometimes called " harriers "? That ' s an interesting fact , I didn ' t know that . It used to be an Olympic sport . During a 1924 race in a Paris heat wave , 8 runners were taken away on a stretcher . I hope that ' s not me .
Surfing looks so fun ! If you don ' t already know , its basically riding on the forward or deep face of a moving wave . How would a beginner get into it ? Well you ' d wanna get a board and go to the ocean , since waves suitable for surfing are primarily found there . Are there any suggestions for staying on the board ? You ' d have to talk to someone who has actually tried it . You could try body boarding instead , since you ride a wave on a bodyboard laying on your belly . Who makes the best boards generally speaking ? I really don ' t know , especially because there are so many different types of surfing , like knee boarding and surf matting . What ' s the best time to go ? It depends since you can either surf in the ocean or utilize artificial waves like from boat wakes and wave pools .
Is Alcohol is a fermented drink ? Alcohol is an organic compound , most alcohol is not fermented , but beer is Is beer not an alcoholic drink ? yes it is but is made with fermented yeast and is one of the oldest and most consumed forms of alcohol OK that ' s true !

Wine is of course made from grapes , it is fermented without the use of sugars or acids OK , what ' s are the world ' s most popular and expensive wine drinks ? I am not sure what the most popular or expensive wines are but it would be based on the type of grape it is made from and how old it is because wine gets better with age Any history of how the earliest wine were made ?

Boxers are gorgeous dogs . Do you like the big breeds or the small breeds ? I like boxers as they ' re medium sized , and short - haired so easy to groom . All 4 of my dogs have been medium sized . They are easier to groom and don ' t take up a lot of room in our bed . I ' ve been studying a little about dog nutrition due to how many different brands of dog food there are , what do you feed yours ? I ' m very particular about dog food . It ' s important to do your research carefully . We have a local company who we get our dog food from . Definitely , I try to focus on good quality meats as their short gastrointestinal tracts are built for it , but I was thinking about trying other foods , any suggestions ? I would suggest looking around your area to see if there is a local company who makes healthy dog food . It tends to be a little more expensive , but I personally find it ' s worth it . That ' s a good idea , I eat pretty healthy myself so I was thinking of maybe making my own dog food , but probably easier to buy it already made huh .

Basketball is a sport played on a rectangular court . its fun to do 2v2 with friends It definitely is a lot of fun , though sometimes I prefer less limited - contact sports . thats fair , i like basketball because its full of constant action .

Hard to believe , but I have a soft spot for heavy metal sometimes ! I know critics often dislike it despite a LARGE fan base , but sometimes ya gotta bang your head I used to thoroughly enjoy heavy metal when i was younger during my teenage years ! Who are some of the best heavy metal bands ? Well we could go old school and nostalgic with 3 of the biggest + baddest : Led Zepellin , Black Sabbath , and Deep Purple ! Did you have a favorite ?

I don ' t follow professional basketball much - more of a college basketball person myself . How about you ? I dont follow basketball much , but I a friend of mine is a fan of the Vancouver Grizzllies . Do they still exist ? I thought they transferred years ago . But what do I know ?! I know they were established in 1995 along with the Toronto Raptors as part of NBA expansion to Canada . Did they ever win anything ? For some reason I never think of Canada as a basketball country . Yes they struggled in the early years but they won a total of 101 games but lost 359 That ' s a terrible record ! Why on earth did your friend support them ? It ' s like my husband supporting the Miami Dolphins , even though they are useless ( he ' s from Miami ). Who knows why anyone support these losing teams ?

Even though I personally don ' t really believe in God , the whole prospect of God and religion has always been sort of interesting . It is very interesting . I share the same thought about God as you . What do you find most interesting ? One part that is interesting is that older civilizations used God ( s ) to explain certain natural processes , like the Sun rising . Does that come from people needing to explain the unexplained ? Pretty much , unexplained things scare people so they need to explain them to put themselves at ease . Especially back then with limited scientific knowledge . Do you know what made people start believing in only one god ? I believe that much of it is due to the rise of Christianity , which is the most popular monotheistic religion ever and still is . You know a lot about this subject . Do you know any other good facts about god ? Well in almost every single religion , God is omniscient , omnipotent , and omnipresent as well .
One of my favorite bands is System of a Down . Have you ever heard their music ? Yeah , SOAD is a heavy metal band from California . I like their fast tempo and clear lyrics . I can always understand what they are singing about . I have trouble understanding them occasionally . The band achieved success with the release of their five studio albums . They like to sing about political events and wars . They have had quite a few big hits . They have a lot of good songs . Must be why three of their albums were debuted on the " Billboard " 200 . Yeah , I am amazed at how popular they have become throughout the world . I want to see them in concert some time .

They are so yummy . They have chili corn dogs too . SO good ! I usually get my fix at the Texas state fair . Turns out a patent was filed for the name in 1927 . Wow , theyve been around for quite awhile then . I didnt know that . I just know that they are good Ketchup or Mustard ? It was introduced to the US by Texas Germans .

Pudding is pretty good , most people consider it to be either a sweet or savory dish I ' ve never had savory pudding . Is it any good ? What flavors does it come in ? I haven ' t ever tried it . It started as meats in a pudding . I would think they used pudding as we do gravy I don ' t think that sounds very appetizing . I don ' t think I would like that texture with my meat . In the U . S . and Canada we mean a sweet milky desert . That ' s the way I ' d like to keep mine . Definitely ! I could eat chocolate pudding every day . Over here made from scratch it ' s usually boiled but most other places its baked I ' ve always just used the boxed mix . It ' s good enough ! Sometimes I make it with fruit juice and add chunks of fruit . So good . Yes , that sounds good ! A lot of people just use the Jell - o line of products , like you and I
My Honda civic is pretty cool . It has gone through some changes and now it is bigger and compact . What year is your " re honda civic and are there any other changes The Civic is inbetween the Honda Fit and the accord . It is a newer model , it has upgrades that most cars nowadays have . oh what kind of upgrades i have a dodge charger i was looking at upgrading my car It has front wheel drive , better interior space and it is becoming more fuel - efficient . I always say the more fuel efficient the better gas is going up steadily . Yes it is always rising . The very first Civic was made in 1972 but as a two - door then a hatchback came that September . The civic has gone through alot of changes over the years , i hope that it maintains some of that classic flair to it . I ' m sure it will , that is what makes it unique . It is constantly being rebadged for the markets overseas .
There are 40 species of dolphins and I probably can ' t identify even one . Wow ! 40 species ? That is a lot more than I would of expected . I can think of the bottlenosed dolphin I think that ' s the one I ' ve seen in Florida . I saw a group of about 15 which they called a pod . I remember swimming with the dolphins when I was a child and thinking how human like they acted Swimming with dolphins would be great ! They weren ' t killer whales , the largest dolphins , were they ? No , these dolphins were much smaller . They seemed very happy and are friendly to humans I don ' t understand this . Killer whales are considered dolphins , and they feed on fish , seals , and ... wait for it ... DOLPHINS ! I can see how they would be in the dolphin family . They are actually very social and have the similar features to dolphins Dolphins are supposed to be very smart , aren ' t they ?
I love salsa dancing for exercise . It works up a sweat ! It ' s hard to believe that Salsa dancing is so popular in America . It originated all the way down in the Caribbean . It ' s a lot of fun . What else is interesting about it ? The salsa ' s movements are derived from several other dances ' forms , including Puerto Rican bomba and plena , Cuban Son , cha - cha - cha , mambo , and others ! Very cool . So it ' s a mexture of all those ? Yes , but it actually originated in New York in the mid - 1970s ! Really ? I ' m surprised it originated in the U . S .
Jamaica is an awesome island country And it ' s also home to Bob Marley . One of the greatest musicians of all time . Bob Marley was one of the best singers to exist and also really helped push weed as something that is not a problem For that I am also very grateful . Cannabis is a blessing to many people with many otherwise untreatable ailments . Medical cannabis is such an important tool , its nice that it is becoming something people dont think is bad anymore From sea to shining sea it ' s becoming legalized . Hopefully now there will be meaningful research into it ' s benefits . Jamaica even has it legalized due to Marleys influence , what a great island country Jamaica has some amazing runners . It ' s incredible how seemingly out of no where they became a nation with some of the best runners in the world . Yep , Usain bolt is from the country Jamaica and he is probably the best runner to ever live
I have three small dogs ! They ' re adorable . They ' re may be the best pet ! They were the very first species to be domesticated , as well . Since then , they ' ve been selectively bred for more than a millennia ! This has been done to achieve certain behaviors , sensory capabilities , and physical attributes , of course . Wow really ? I just bought mine from the breeder and didn ' t think too much about where they came from . You choosing dogs as pets is wise . Dogs being associated with humans has encouraged them to become uniquely attuned to human behavior , which has led them to be so much more better suited to co - exist and be pets with humans over other canid species . Yes , mine always seem to know when I am getting sick and they spend time with me . I ' m glad to hear it . But of course affection isn ' t the only role they play . The serve in hunting , herding , pulling loads , protection , assisting police / military , and also helping those who are handicapped or who need therapy ! Mine are only small , so I don ' t know how much policing they will be doing . But I always wanted a big German Shepard .
My dad wants to go kayaking but I dont now anything about it . Well it ' s a pretty tough activity , physically I mean . Just some background , a kayak is a low - to - the - water , canoe - like boat and you have a paddler who sits facing forward and uses a double - bladed paddle to propel the boat . Yeah I have heard that it is kinda dangerous . It can be if you don ' t know what you ' re doing , the kayak was actually created thousands of years ago by the Inuit believe it or not I did not know it was that old ! Do you know anything else interesting about it ? Well speaking of the old kayaks , they were actually made of driftwood and sometimes whale skeleton was used to construct the frame ! I thin my dads is carbonfiber I guess now they make them out of that .
It ' s summertime and I know snakes will be more active . Snakes terrify me ! I don ' t like their elongated and legless bodies . They freak me out ! Me too ! I can ' t stand them and I ' ve started to put mothballs around my home ' s foundation . I knew mothballs were pesticide but I wasn ' t aware they helped to prevent snakes from entering . The National Pesticide Information Center website do state it has little effect on them : but the act makes me feel better . The National Pesticide Info Center helps us by providing objective information on pesticides . I wonder if there is an effective method of preventing snakes from entering . I always try to make sure in the spring that there isn ' t a food source for rodents in the summer . The website does have that recommendation . I will definitely keep that in mind . I live in a hot and humid location and I ' m sure we have tons of snakes around here ! The humidity here in SC has increased dramatically over the years and I ' m seeing more Black King snakes I lived in Charleston , South Carolina for twenty years before moving here to Florida . I did see a lot of snakes there !
Linkin Park is my favorite band ! I even went to one of their concerts ! I love Linkin Park . I liked them in 199 when they first started . Awesome ! I have a bunch of their songs on my mp3 player so I can listen to them when I go jogging ! I really like Meteora in 2003 . That ' s a great song ! All their songs are fantastic , but that one really stands out . I like how they adapted nu metal and rap metal . Me too - I hope they never break up the band - I hate when that happens !
Im proud to say im a carnivore , is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly meat I am too ! But I never really thought about being a carnivore !

Do you know any animals which would qualify as obligate carnivores ? I think rats do , Omnivores also consume both animal and non - animal food That ' s more like me ! I love meat , but I like vegetables too ! A carnivore at the top of the food chain is called a apex predator
i dont eat meat That ' s interesting ... do you consider yourself vegetarian or vegan ? Vegans don ' t eat anything that contains animal by - products . vegan That ' s great ! So am I . I enjoy going to vegan festivals to try out new foods and products .

I ' ve brought many non - vegan friends . They ' ve enjoyed the music and the food . It was eye opening for them ... edutainment at its best ! that ' s great
Are you familiar with the early 1970 ' s musicale style disco ? Oh yes I am it was a lot of fun ! Awesome . I remember Disco was hugely popular through the mid 1970s to the early 1980s . It really was a different time . It was a great time and the music was awesome as well I remember listening to disco and doing the Bump and the Hustle on the dancefloor . Yes I did those dances too and remember the disco lights lol I really like the sounds of disco . The string sections , electric piano , and the electric rhythm guitar were so unique . Yes and combine the music with a cool place and a disco light and it was a heck of a party I wonder what disco was like when it was just house parties . They would make makeshift discotheques .

I don ' t play video games , implying any type of display device that produces 2 or 3 dimensional images . Ok . Have you ever played one ? Maybe Pac - Man or Super Mario ? Many people like to play games on their phones these days . I played Mario Kart a few times with my kids when they were younger on our Wii . I love Mario Kart . The one that came out on Super Nintendo in the 1990s is still being played today . Amazing how long it has been out . My husband has an Xbox now but I can ' t play Mario as it ' s only at an arcade or the Nintendo game systems Yes , that is true . The best game for Xbox is Halo . Showtime is going to make a new TV series based off it ! I do enjoy going to Dave and Busters - there aren ' t many arcades around anymore due to the home game consoles . We have a Dave and Busters here which my kids love to go to . Yes , when I was a kid I spent a lot of time in arcades . My parents would never let me get a console .
Hello ! I heard you liked to go for walks with your Corgi . I don ' t know much about them . What can you tell me ? Well Corgis are also called Welsh Corgis , for one thing . Why is that ?

How do you read ? For me , the process is tiring Of course it can be tiring being a complex " cognitive process " of decoding symbols in order to construct or derive meaning Sometimes , I put my legs in water just to concentrate and not to sleep How does that help since reading process requires continuous practice , development , and refinement . It helps by keeping one awake . But when one keeps practicing it , the person will get used to it Well , I am not sure how that helps but anyways reading requires creativity and critical analysis . SO maybe that could be some therapy for it . Exactly , but do you enjoy reading Of course yes and even Extensive reading which is a way of language learning , including foreign language learning , through large amounts of reading . Wow , you must be a genius . Very intelligent
French Bulldogs , or Frenchies , are such great dogs . I am not sure I know them , Are they like very small bulldogs ? Yeah exactly ! They were one of the most popular registered dogs in the United Kingdom . They are pretty cute I think , are French Bulldogs originally from the United Kingdom ?

In 2009 italy had a request to make the Neopolitan pizza and to make it registered with the European Union as a traditional dish . I did not know that . Italy stole our pizza ? There are independent stores and chains as well as cafes that serve pizza on their menu .
Beets .... besides food , they are used for food coloring ! I ' ve dyed Easter eggs with beet juice before . Wow , that is amazing ! Beets are very nutritious . They are a great source of great source of vitamins and minerals such as folate , manganese , iron , vitamin C , vitamin B - complex , copper , and potassium ! They are super healthy , but super yucky in my opinion . In the middle 19th century , they used beetroot juice to color wine . I wonder how it affected the taste ? The Amish still use beets to make wine . They add plenty of sugar to mask that beety taste ! That ' s smart of them ! You can harvest earlier and use the greens for eating , too . That might taste better . Beets are also used to treat medical conditions such as liver disease . They truly are a miracle plant ! Oh , they also are used to treat illnesses relating to digestion and blood issues .
My son wants a motorcycle but knowing it only has 2 wheels , instead of 4 scares me . Do you like motorcycles ? I think motorcycles are great , but I am concerned about their safety .

I don ' t even know what a semitone is . A semitone is a half tone and is called the most dissonant when sounded harmonically . It ' s a bit complicated I would say but it ' s common in Western tonal music . I ' m not sure what that means but I will take your word for it . Do you have a favorite guitarist ?

I love watching game shows ! They involve answering questions and solving puzzles for money . Do you like them ? Oh yeah I really like Jeopardy and stuff like that , I guess those are trivia shows not game shows though . The very first TV game show was called Spelling Bee , it was broadcast back in 1938 !

Guess what , I love lady gaga , lets dance is the greatest club song of all time . What you know about that ? Well I know that Gaga began her musical career by performing songs at a lot ofopen mic nights and school plays . Seems like a good portion of fans dont know that . Yeah They think she was a celebrity overnight Yea they dont seem to realize becoming such a big star involved a lot of recognition and the right people seeing you perform , Also seeing talent agents is a good way as well . Yeah being connected it more important than being good especially in the generic pop music space . Indeed there was a ton of major events and trends in popular music in the 2000s and it took a while for pop music to catch on , I think thats why gaga was so popular . Well she is definitely an odd character if you have ever hear her speak , but thats probably why Llke her , but recently her music hasn ' t been as good I agree , She has been known for her unconventionality and provocative work lately and its not looking too good , Shes also been experimenting with new looks and images for herself , have you seen the crazy stuff she wears ?

Hi , I am a vegan . Do you like to eat plant - based meals ? I have always been fond of abstaining from the use of animal products . I think it is moral issue What about it has made you come to that conclusion ?

What about the health benefits ? Do you think it is healthier for humans ? Well , you may miss important source of protein from vegan type of food intake . But i think it is worth doing for noble cause Can we not get protein from other non - animal sources ?

Children whose parent would divorce definitely suffers a lot in their entire life . Yes the dissolution of a marriage better known as divorce can cause issues with children for sure . Divorce is not the solution for the conflicts between the family . Many of them does not know the value of the relationship formed by the marriage . I agree . Also with all the legal issues that require the court to decide on child custody , asset distribution etc . divorce is a lot of pain and suffering . Few years before , the children were does not aware and know about the word divorce . But now a days , it becomes a word we use in our daily life . Yes divorce is so commonplace nowadays . The custody of the children are awarded to the parent by a judge . They have the right to make decisions for the child . The couples who engaged in divorce , should think about the life and future of their children . If they do so , then there should some noticeable changes in their minds . And sometimes they may be awarded joint custody , which is when both parties have custody , which could be confusing through the children . And some of the strict awareness program should be conducted for the couples . And their notice period for divorce should be made longer .
So I have a phobia of the dark . I ' ve had it since I was a kid . Apparently it ' s pretty common , at least that ' s what my parents told me ! From what I know , it is one of the more common ones . I imagine it ' s triggered by something , like a scary movie . Do you know anything about yours ? I ' ve always been more scared of imagined dangers that could be there , and not as much as the darkness itself . My cousin got his fear after watching ' It ' with the clown . I imagine it ' s similar with you where you got scared at some point and never grew out of it For me it wasn ' t so much a movie , but just a general fear . I heard it ' s pretty natural for kids to some degree . It can be a phase ... but I ' m still scared , so I guess not haha Well I ' m not an expert so I suppose I don ' t have the exact answer lol Yeah I don ' t know either . The researchers Sigmund Freud said it was a manifestation of separation anxiety . I don ' t recall separating from anyone though ...
if you want to improve your health , I suggest starting with a healthy diet . What type of diet do you think is best for weight loss ? I think plant based is a good one . It will help with a reduction of body mass and give good sources of b12 That is good to know . Do you think there are any bad side effects from abstaining from meat ? It is important to know the variations of vegetarianism and you can pick to eat eggs and dairy or not , so you can bypass side effects . That makes sense . I know there are many cultures in the world that are strictly vegetarian and seem to be very healthy . This is true , and it can be adopted for many various reason , vegetarianism that is .

I am color blind . I have a decreased ability to see differences in color . Oh wow ... are you completely colorblind or is it a specific type ? Not completely , no . I can still see colors , I just have difficulty with specific colors , like telling the difference between red and green . Ahh I see . So what is that like ? Is there a way to fix it ? I have heard that there are special glasses you can wear that will help . So there isn ' t a cure , but since I was diagnosed with this disorder , I went to a specialist who taught me certain methods of coping . Ahhh . What kind of methods do you use ? Which ones work best ? Just learning to adapt ! Like , for example little things that people take for granted , like telling the difference between stop red and green stop lights . Interesting ! My wife is actually colorblind as well , but she has trouble seeing yellow and green . Yellow is pink , and green is blue . Wow that ' s weird ! I am a woman too , so it ' s weird to hear about when other women are color blind . Being color blind is more common in males , because females have two X chromosomes , and the defect for color blindness is usually on just one X chromosome so the other compensates .
do you have or know anyone with alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence ? My uncle actually abused alcohol pretty hard in his younger days . It is a terrible situation to see . It surely seems like it , not to mention all the bad effects , such as getting in risky situations like drinking and driving or unsafe physical encounters I agree , I think we have enough drunk drivers on the road doing enough damage . That is why I like chackpoints , they are in locations where the incoming traffic cannot observe it until it is too late Oh you mean sobriety checkpoints ? With the 4th of July coming up , I ' m sure there will be lots of those . Yeah , drunk driving is so dangerous , it is the leading mortality cause of people aged 15 - 29 in Europe Do you have anyone that has been in trouble for driving intoxicated ? Luckily I have not , I am glad my family has never put anyone in a tough spot that way

Both are great schools ! I love the whole feeling of the city , if that makes sense . It ' s not over crowded , but not a small town . Is there anything specific to culture or history related to Syracuse that makes it unique ? I think it ' s neat that Syracuse is named after a city on the eastern coast of Sicily ! Oh , huh , I guess I never would have thought that was the case . I wonder why they chose that ! Maybe there ' s a big Italian community there or something . What else specific can you tell me ? In 2010 , Forbes rated Syracuse fourth in the top ten places to raise a family in the U . S . I guess I ' m not the only one who loves the city ! That ' s pretty nice .. I would never have guessed that , but maybe it makes sense in terms of cost of living , etc . Wonder why they were rated highly . Can you tell me anything else nice about Syracuse ? Syracuse is great for conventions . There ' s a really beautiful convention complex downtown ! It brings a lot of revenue to the city .
How can you explain people can change emotional behaviors all of a sudden ? Sounds like it could be Bipolar disorder . :( What do you know about it ?

Thank you Italy . In 2009 pizza was recognized as a Speciality Guaranteed Dish !

There were 5 poems about a ship ' s progress northward . Sounds interesting , I guess he was before his time in modern poetry with different themes to the traditional love poetry .

More of a realistic in comparison to traditional poets in history like Wordsworth and so on a century or so before , yes ?

Yes , because if you have to sleep during the day , it can be hard on the one who doesn ' t have to .

It is an exercise but it can also be a nice recreation , enjoyed socially on all sorts of events . Is it very time consuming to learn the dances ? I ' d say so , but most of all it ' s important to enjoy it . It ' s nice when you go into adolescence with passion for dancing . This way since teenage years you can continue with a child passion into adulthood . Will you teach it to your children some day ? I might because it can be good for a child development , it is a biological , psychological and emotional process of changes in the early life of a child until adolescence . Activity like dancing could be good for it . Yes , I bet they would probably learn the steps faster than most adults too !

The ones hear are pretty tiny , but when we lived in Florida we saw pretty big ones that would creep me out !

I always found it weird when I found out there were cows involved in marsh - mellows so imagine the other foods that animal ingredients are used in . Its crazy All of those restrictions can pose some nutrition problems as well

I had an almond milk cappuccino today , it was not the best ! LOL - I was on a special diet for a while and could only use almond milk in any kind of coffee . Yuck ! Yeah it seems strange to me that something consisting of just almonds and water can make a milk looking substance LOL

A polyglot is different from multilingualism because it means a person who learns multiple languages as an avocation . What does the work avocation mean ? Does that have to do with work ?

I ' ve got a bunch of friends who are in their 30 ' s who are still into skateboarding . It ' s kind of cool , because it ' s not only a form of transportation , but it ' s an art form , and exercise , and it can even be a job . I think it ' s dangerous as form of transportation . Someone could easily get hurt . You just have to wear a helmet ! Pads , if you ' re really nervous . There are , after all , about 11 million skateboarders in the world . Can ' t be that dangerous ... It ' s dangerous for other people . You might be safe wearing a helmet and pads , but what about the person you run into on the sidewalk ? You just dismount briefly , if you ' re concerned about a collision . Plus , there are skateparks , places specifically designed for skateboarders to practice and work on their tricks . There ' s a whole culture around it that ' s been around since the 70s . Certainly , skateboard parks are fine , but on sidewalks and on the road , skateboarders pose a risk to other people . Agree to disagree , I suppose . Skateboarding has become so mainstream and -- for the most part -- socially accepted , that it will be one of the sports represented at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo .

And not only do I eat just cheese , I get EXTRA cheese ! I will prob have a heart attack but oh well LOL !!

Oh , it can happen every day for months ! There are about 10 % of women that still get morning sickness even after 20 weeks ! I heard some woman can get really sick from pregnancy also , but it ' s like a 5 - 10 % chance . Yes , it can happen .

I don ' t know what I ' ve been missing by not eating steak sooner in my life . I love that there are so many different kinds of cuts of steak to enjoy , too ! Skirt steak , flank steak , silverfinger steak .. I have much to catch up on . Can you tell me more about how to cook steak ? It ' s a big process of discovering how you like it , and what ' s easiest for you . Generally , it ' s grilled because people want to replicate the certain flavor that comes about when it ' s cooked over the coals of an open fire . But you have other options , like cooking it in sauce ( e . g . in a steak and kidney pie ), or putting it into patties for hamburgers . Up to the user ! Is steak limited to just beef or is there such a thing as chicken steak and stuff like that ?/ The word usually refers to beefsteak ; but absolutely , yes , there can be other kinds , like fish steak , or steak from bison , camel , goat , kangaroo , ostrich , reindeer , zebu , horse ... and the list goes on . It ' s kind of a catch - all term . Interesting , let ' s discuss a different food idea , like eggs for instance . How do you like to prepare your eggs ? Me personally ? I ' m a poached egg kind of guy . I like eggs cooked outside of the shell by it being poached / steamed , so that it ' s more delicately cooked . I love them just as much as I love steak because of the protein they provide , which is great for your diet . Sorry I meant food item not food idea . I ' ve never tried poached eggs , I ' m more a hard - boiled person , but it seems like a novel cooking method . Give it a shot ! It ' s easy , but you have to be precise and paying attention . Mainly you ' re cracking an egg into a cup / bowl , then sliding that into a pan of water that ' s heated to 75 degrees celsius , cooking it until the egg white is mostly solid but with a soft yolk -- that ' s key . You want a runny yolk with a slightly hardened crust , but no raw white .
I love comic books , especially Marvel comics . Are you familiar with comics ? I ' ve always wanted to read them but there just seem to be so many to choose from ! It ' s true , it can be overwhelming ! My advice is to focus on one of the major characters at first . My faves are Spider - man , Thor , and X - Men . Hey , I recognize those heroes . Comic books must have been popular for a really long time , huh ? Definitely ! Marvel started way back in 1939 as Timely Publications ; but the modern Marvel that we know today wasn ' t around til the 60s . I think I ' d have to say I like the name Marvel a lot better ! Do you know who one of the first Marvel heroes were they started making comics about ? Yeah , the Fantastic Four was one of the first big ones from the 60s . But most of the popular heroes , like Iron Man and Spider - man also showed up around that time . I ' ll definitely have to check some out . Is it best to start at the beginning of a series ? A lot of the older comics are boring to read nowadays . But they re - launch each comic every few years , so there ' s always a good jumping - on point .

I ' ve never played the game Blackjack . Can you tell me anything about it ? Ah , the game also know as twenty - one ! Of course I can . So , usually there ' s several people and then a dealer . You all compete against the dealer , trying to beat him ! Blackjack Right , yeah . So if you ' re wondering how you beat the dealer , you get dealt two cards during the game , and so does the dealer . You then add up your hand and try to get as close to 21 without going over ! That ' s really cool ! So you are really just playing against the dealer and no one else ? Pretty much , yeah . And the cards have different values .

It ' s just like poker , where you can try to cheat by either collusion , or using sleight - of - hand to switch cards , or going as far as physical devices like marked cards or holdout devices .

I am highly impressed with how the incorporate the computer industry for more outstanding visuals and effects , like the green screen , and similar I also really like science fiction mainly because they ' re based on real science and I think that ' s interesting . Real scientific fact is definitely a plus . It reflects I sometimes feel , how knowledgeable the writers are , as opposed to writing films primarily for the entertainment effect . There ' s a sci - fi museum in Hollywood that has exhibits of moveis and TV shows . I ' d love to visit there . When I was out there , California , I would always walk through the areas where the museums were , and the Walk of Fame , but I was generally speeding to an appointment or something work related , than as a tourist and checking out all of the fantastic attractions of and including the sci - fi museum . Next time I ' m there , it will be soley as a tourist , and not so much homestead . There ' s so many cool places out there . There is also a horror museum in Los Angeles . It wasn ' t there last time I visited . I want to see that .

I have been caught up in a lie , I regret telling a lie but I wanted to fit in around the underwater diving teams in my area . Anyway , I said I knew a lot of it and I actively did underwater diving , all is a lie . Do you know any info on it that can help get me out of this hole ? Um , I can ' t help you with that . Let ' s talk about DIVING ! That ' s where humans descend below the water surface . Yes ! That will work fine . I bet it ' s the same thing . Typically when we dive , it ' s usually under water , so this info will save me . I have learned not to tell lies over this one , thank you so much Human beings are not adapted to the environment of diving that is where various equipment has been developed to help with that . That makes sense , I should of guessed that but had nothing to say , what else ? Scuba diving is a form of diving where divers carry their own source of breathing gas . That is a good tip to give me too . I had my stuff all packed up to show off and never wondered how I would breath underwater . Is it an individual or group activity ? I think it is best to dive with someone . Diving safety depends on a dive team . Great ! I already have my diving buddy in mind . You are helping so much deary , I can ' t thank you enough !
Hey ! Do you like to surf on the waves ? I ' ve never surfed on waves . They scare me . Should I be scared ?

Never hurt myself ! My desire for the best possible waves has made me really dependent on weather conditions ! Where have you surfed ? Are there better conditions in different areas ? The best waves are usually in the ocean but you can find some in lakes or rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore . You could also use artificial waves ! I never thought about waves in the lakes or rivers . Sure ! In river surfing the wave is stationary on the river and it ' s caused usually by a high volume of water flowing over a rock or something .
I have a small Beagle and I call him droopy , he ' s my best friend . That ' s so cool , I saved a beagle once , it was the laziest lil pup I ' ve ever seen .

I ' d get a stray and save one myself if I could . Yeah my second dog was a street dog that was abandoned , he is purebred blue heeler too , which is not okay . That ' s horrible how people abandon dogs , I can ' t believe that . Why not just find a home for it instead ? And Blue Heelers are really awesome .

Paris looks very lively . I heard there are a lot of museums there . It must me rich in history . It ' s rich in history , and people flock to it because of its history , culture , and scenery . This is evidenced by the fact that it ' s considered the heart of the Île - de - France region , and had 18 % of France ' s population in 2016 , with 12 , 142 , 802 people . I had no idea Paris was that populated . Anything I shouldnt miss if I make out there ?

I am an only child . So you have no siblings , either biological nor adopted ? No I do not and it was lonely growing up . Only children are actually pretty uncommon throughout history . Yeah I have noticed that . Although , from around the middle of the 20th century , birth rates actually fell and so did the average family size , mostly due to increasing costs of raising children .

I remember going to the movies to see it , seems like not that long ago but it was over 20 years now !

Do you have any children ? I have a three year old and parenting can be difficult . I do not but it really can be , you really have to do a lot . What do you know about parenting ? Different parenting styles can really pay a role on it . It ' s more psychological than anything . Oh really ? Like development of their social and mental skills ? Yea , kids have fragile little minds , parenting styles heavily influence they way they turn out to be . Yea that makes sense , you really dont realize how strong parenting styles and parental influence can really affect a childs mindset and how they think when they grow up . It ' s pretty neat becuase the quality of your parenting can actually be much more essential that the actual amount of time you spend with your kid . That makes perfect sense , quality over quantity , anything else I should know ? That people arent perfect so dont expect to be a perfect parent .
I really enjoy playing over watch . I ' ve been playing it since it ' s release back in May 2016 . Have you ever played it ? I have heard it but don ' t know much about it . What is it like ? It ' s a team based multiplayer online first - person shooter video game . Oh okay so it is kind of like Call of Duty ? Yes . The game assigns players into 2 teams of 6 . Each person can select a different character that has their own unique style of play . That sounds quite interesting . How long does each game typically last ? I ' m not sure exactly , it depends .. But the players on a team work together to secure and defend control points on a map .
Cupcakes are so delicious , don ' t you want to eat one for every meal ! I would love it if that were possible . What are your favorite kind ? Oh , it ' s hard to choose , there are so many varieties , especially because you can add fruit and candy That sounds delicious . How long have cupcakes been a thing ? Well , the earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was in 1796 , and it ' s sounded delicious ! Wow . 1796 . That ' s really neat !. What else do you know about cupcakes ? Oh well , before the invention of muffin tins , they were often baked in individual pottery cups , ramekins , or molds , isn ' t that neat ! That is neat ! I bet that took a long time to cook each one .... unless they put them in the oven at the same time . Oh probably , but now we ' ve come so far with technology that we have them to be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup to make it easier !
I really enjoy when it rains outside ! It makes me want to relax and watch a movie or take a nap ! I enjoy that as well . Not to mention that rain is responsible for giving us most of our freshwater on the planet Yeah , I have a little garden at my house and I appreciate the rain because it really helps the plant grow faster and bigger ! I am just a big fan of all things water , such as snow , clouds , and especially fog I really love the snow as well . It allows me to snowboard ! I always forget that fog is actually water . Yes it is from nearby bodies of water and is really a low flying cloud Fascinating ! Water can be quite dangerous though since it can obstruct vision when driving or doing other things . It can be . But without it , there would not be suitible enough conditions for a lot of ecoystems Very true ! It is vital for life !
Do you ever watch the equestrian performance sport with a jockey and driver ? no i have never watch their performance but i do love watching equestrian , i love horse Yeah I love horses . They ' ve been domesticated since 4000 BC and more in 3000BC . wow , also their scientific name is Equus ferus caballus Yeah there are sub species of this Equus ferus that were wild and descended from domesticated horses . the only thing i kind of dislike about equestrian is the waiting time on the horse rider change I bet . It ' s crazy how horse racing has a long history across civilizations . yeah , and any part of the world you will find horses and sports relating to horses Yeah the odd toed ungulate mammal is seen everywhere .
I ' m planning a trip to the beach , but I ' ve never been to one ! you have never been , oh wow it is so nice and really a wonder how the water stops right alongside the land , a miracle really It sounds really beautiful !

evening , i do like to make cakes Do you like chocolate cakes that are flavored with melted chocolate ? love chocolate cake , but i cannot eat too much , diet I love it to , but I am in the same boat as you with the diet , so I have been experimenting with using different ingredients . I have found a few alternative sweeteners that make it delicous and low calorie . You should try it . really ? what is the sweetener ? I use stevia . It is extracted from the leaves of a plant called Stevia rebaudiana . It takes some getting used to but is worth it . okay , i am aware of it but it only comes in packets i think and not in bulk for baking You can get stevia drops that are a liquid for and very concentrated . The only problem is some brands can have a bitter taste so you have to be careful not to ruin your cake . i may try it but I need to find a recipe on how to use it

So how long has weight lifting been in the Olympics ? Not sure ? The clean press used to be a competition lift but it was stopped because its too difficult to judge Interesting , my guess is its been around since the beginning ! Yes , that would be hard to judge . Do you have any favorite weightlifting people in the olympics ? Not really but each weightlifter gets three attempts to lift the weight
Tupac sold over 75 million records ! Can you believe that ?! I had no idea he sold that many records Many of his songs are about violence and hardship in the inner city . It ' s really relatable to a lot of people . That ' s a very good point . Are you a fan of his music ? Yes of course . His music is heavily influenced by ideals of the Black Panther Party , because lots of his family members were Black Panthers . That ' s very interesting . And do you support the Black Panthers as well ? No , not really . But I think they ' re interesting ! Do you have a lot of Tupac ' s albums ? Yes , I own some of them . Do you ?
I hope you are doing well . I was wondering the other day that if we should still do American Civil War reenactment I think the reenactment of real battles in history are perfectly fine , many hobbyists love Civil War reenactments Yes , but they do not represent current lives and it is difficult to relate . Those who like to participate can those who do not know history do not have to , this is mainly done in the US , but other countries like the UK , Germany and others also do these and they did not have the Civil War The problem I see is that it is mainly on the field battle that we see , but the real war happened behind closed doors ( politicians ) and we put to much focus on the reenactment of battles . You know reenactments of the Cicil War actually began before the real battle had even ended I did not know that , but still why ? From what you are telling me , it seems more for amusement ( theater ) than history . What about other wars that the US was part of . Even the American Revolution does not see as much reenactment . there are reenactments of all of the wars , the Civil War being most popular because it was fought on US soil , and it was US against US , the biggest popularity came between the 80 ' s and 90 ' s Have you ever attended a reenactment . I have not ? Maybe I should , I might be missing something . I have been once , not really into that but a lot of the reinactors were decendants of those who actually fought , years ago the actual veterans would reenact to honor they fallen comrades
tacos are a great and tasty mexican dish I love how versatile tacos can be - do you know some of the more unique kinds ? you can get tacos with any toppings on corn or flour tortillas soft or hard , its great . i like shrimp tacos for example Fish tacos are really good also - where did Tacos originate ? They are a very old mexican dish and since they are cheap and simple they are eaten quite often Do you know how they were brought to the United States ? Tacos were brought over like anything , people moved here and showed others how to make them , they are easy to eat and delicious so they caught on I like soft tacos more than the hard ones - I wonder which one is more authentic ? tacos on soft corn tortillas are the most authentic and taste the best imo
When I hear the word , equestrian , I have to wonder why we can ' t just say horse rider . It is interesting you say that , equestrian is derived from Latin . It means horseman referring to their skill on a horse . That is interesting . Did you look it up or are you involved in equestrianism ? I had to look it up , I always wondered what the term actually meant . Have you ever ridden horse ? I rode a horse when I was a kid once , it was a guided tour on a ranch . I only road for tourism reasons . Have you ever ridden a horse ? I have done a few trail rides at the state parks . It is fun .
I am a girl who loves sports cars and video games ! Do you like either of those ? They are electronic games using a video device . I love video games ! My favourite is Super Mario - not too difficult , and it ' s fun ! Yeah ! Me too ! I love to follow Mario ' s adventures in the fictional mushroom kingdom . It ' s really a classic . They don ' t make games like that anymore ! The ones today are just too complicated for me ! I know right ? Some people think of video games as an art form . Other people disagree with that . What do you think ? I do think they are an art form - so much creativity goes into creating them ! For sure ! I like how many different platforms you can use . People game on computers all the way down to small handheld devices . My first gaming platform was the Commodore Vic 20 - that was a very long time ago ! Wow ! That ' s the old 8 bit computer sold by Commodore Business Machines ? Was that before or after the Commodore 64 ?
I really love cupcakes , whats your favorite flavor ? You mean those fairy cakes , buns , or patty cakes design for one person ? I like strawberry shortcake . What about you ? I love any kinda of cake to be honest . Do you usually eat your cake plain or with icing ? I always use icing and other cake decorations like fruit and sprinkles . Cream cheese is also delicious . Yes I agree cream cheese tastes amazing on cake . Do you know how many calories are in a piece of cake ? Gee , it completely depends on the ingredients and who makes them . The English fairy cakes vary in size a lot . The American cup cake is more of a standard size . Yes i find it wild how cakes can be so different in so many countries , It seems that each country has their own specific flavors . Totally . Years ago before muffin tins were invented the cup cakes were made in little individual pottery cups . Today you cake even bake a little cake in a coffee mug in the microwave ! Thats fascinating , I guess back then they had very limited ways to cook cakes .
I have naturally red hair , it ' s pretty rare , only 1 - 2 % of people have it ! Awesome ! I didn ' t know that . Oddly , I have red hair as well ! That ' s crazy the odds of both us meeting must be really low ! Apparently it ' s more common in people with northern or western European ancestry ( 2 - 6 %). And according to my dna testing I have a lot of Northern European / Ireland specifically Well that certainly makes sense then ! What kind of hue is your hair ? Mine is kind of a bright copper hue . I wish mine was more copper ... it ' s more ..." orange " haha There ' s probably a way to change it , though I don ' t know if it would be good for your hair . Some people even have strawberry blond red - hair , the variation is crazy . that ' s probably what my color would be strawberry blondish . Unfortunately I am getting gray hairs , so I ' ve turned to dying it I think gray hairs are something to be proud of personally , I ' ve had some even since I was like 16 , which seems to defy their normal pattern .

It ' s amazing how many different types of songs there are ! Has rock music been around for awhile ? Sure , it started in the 1940s and 1950s , and came into its own in the 1960s . Oh , I guess that would be today ' s classic rock ! Do you have a favorite rock band ? I really love Bon Jovi . Slippery When Wet is a great album . I think that ' s my friend ' s favorite !

Dutch apple pie ! With whipped cream and vanilla ice cream Yes ! Do you prefer a filled pie , where the crust is only on the bottom , or a two crust pie , where the crust is also on top ? I prefer filled pie , the Dutch kind . It ' s so good ... And I prefer the crust sweet , not salty I prefer the filled kind too , otherwise there is too much crust . Also , there is a kind called top crust , where the filling is only on the bottom and the crust is only on top ? I like the one with the crust on the bottom , and not on top . That ' s a little too much . I do like a little crumble though . Yeah the crust on top seems like a mess , so I have never made one like that . I think my favorite pie to make is apple . I ' ve never made one from scratch . I need to do it one day though . I prefer eating them over making them After the apples are cut it is a breeze ! I like apple pies because you can make patterns by stacking the apples and layering with crust !
I really like pecan pie . It ' s my favorite ! I only recently started eating it . It never sounded good because its nuts with a filling of eggs butter and corn syrup but it is ! It ' s really good . Unhealthy but good ! Another thing I like about it is depending on what you have on hand you can use brown sugar , sugar syrup , molasses , maple syrup , or honey . I ' ve never had it with any of those . What else can you tell me ? I find it interesting that some people add chocolate and / or bourbon in some versions . Not sure how I would like that I don ' t think I would . Why change something that is already great ?!
One of my favorite foods is ravioli . I like to call them meat pillows . My favorite food too . It is made by using two layer of thin pasta dough I like to have meat in my ravioli .

I used to have chinchillas and parrots

Lizards are versatile I guess .
Broccoli is my favorite vegetable . Hmmm , I love it too . I just had it tonight in a noodle and veggie mixture with peanut lime sauce on it . I ' ve heard broccoli is super special for its nutrients . I bet it is . It ' s strange that broccoli did not become widely popular until the 1920s . Oh weird . I would ' ve thought it was a lot older than that . How did it even get discovered ? Broccoli was first introduced to the US by Southern Italian immigrants . It came from Italy ? That is so neat . I can ' t remember what vitamins are in it but I know it helps kill cancer cells . Really , I didn ' t know that . I also remembered that Italians have considered broccoli to be highly valuable food since the Roman Empire . Cool . Did they trade it ? How did they use it ? Was it something only royalty got ? Well , considering Rome was the largest city in the world BC , I would imagine it was .

I am a computer repair technician . Business has been tough lately because no one buys computers anymore ! That is surprising to me . I thought computer technicians would be super busy maintaining computers and servers . My focus was initially on home computers . I ' ve had to diversify and learn more about commercial systems and servers . I would think that home computers would be where its at money wise . Home computers are super affordable these days . They are very affordable but more and more families aren ' t buying them , opting instead to use their phones and tablets . That also surprises me . I can see tablets being used and bought more frequently , but not phones . I enjoy the graphics on a computer . You might be right , I guess a lot of people are using desktop computers for gaming . It is an emerging market , maybe I should also focus on those types of machines . thanks for the idea ! Do you also expand memory in your job ? Yeah a lot of commercial companies need more storage . Everything is now stored digitally , so that means a lot of upgrades to infrastructure , mostly memory and speed .

During the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show he removed part of Janet Jackson ' s clothing , exposing part of her breast . The event was referred to as " NippleGate ".
I find tattoes ineresting as a form of body modification where a design is made inserting ink in the skin Yeah , it depicts a lot of things to those who have them , some use it as a memorial on certain events yes it can be a form of expressing to the world who you are .

Its what ' s in vogue , seems like a fashion trend , most famous persons love to have tattoos . Yes but it wasn ' t until the end of the 20th century that the stigmas of tattoes were dismissed and it became an acceptable practice for everyone . Some historical perceptions believed that tattoos was synonymous with the slave thing , as a mark to identity slaves . Yes , probably because slaves where marked as they still do with cattle today . It seems that the word Tattoe comes from the Polynesian word Tatu meaning to write

A lot of people liken it to totalitarian dictatorships , though . Yeah . It ' s running pretty rampant in China and deals with 2 classes that are the root of all problems in society that will ultimately be solved through a revolution I wouldn ' t be surprised . Revolutions are the natural result of disenfranchisement . The revolution will allow the working class into power which will implement social ownership of the means of hard work which is the first element in turning society into a communistic presence . The revolution will be inevitable if conditions worsen for the masses .

I learned alot in history classes , Algeria shares its border with Tunisia to the northeast , to the east by Libya , to the west by Morocco , to the southwest by the Western Saharan territory , Mauritania , and Mali , to the southeast by Niger , and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea . Wow , I love to see the Mediterranean sea some time . my parents said it was so beautiful !

And dating back thousands of years for its great resources . Amazing , I will have to plan to visit soon . Do you know if there is a large population in Algeria ?
Parrots are such cool birds , especially how they can mimic sounds . They are so cool . There is a debate in the science community that not only can they talk , but also have some cognitive understanding of language as well . There was one parrot that I read about and he seemed so smart . I think it was named Alex . That ' s a good name for a parrot . There are 393 species and they are also known as psittacines . That ' s so many , I never would ' ve thought there could be that many species of them . You can tell it ' s a parrot if they have a strong curved bill , they have an upright stance and clawed zygodactyl feet . Yeah they are really easy to distinguish from other birds . Most of them eat nuts and seeds but there are a few species that sometimes eat animals . I ' d stay away from those ! I ' ve fed some before so I know that they usually love seeds .

I love vanilla flavor . Vanilla is a flavoring derived from orchids of the genus " Vanilla ", primarily from the Mexican species I like vanilla flavoring too ! I especially enjoy vanilla syrup in my coffee when I make my espresso at home ! vanilla ", derived from , the diminutive of the Spanish word (" vaina " itself meaning sheath or pod ), is translated simply as " little pod ". That ' s pretty cool . It makes sense , since it does come in those little pods . Pre - Columbian Mesoamerican people cultivated the vine of the vanilla orchid , called " tlilxochitl I imagine it has been around for many , many years then , huh ? Pollination is required to set the vanilla fruit
I use to always want a Siberian Husky when I was younger they are so beautiful . I have one . I use him as a sled dog . Really so cool do you live in Canada or somewhere where it snows ? Yes , I live up north in Toronto . There are a lot of huskies here . People like them because of their fast pulling style . I seen them on movies when they pull the sleds they are originated in Northeast Asia wonder how they breed and got over where we could buy them . I ' m not sure , but they are genetically similar to the gray wolf . They have this mysterious look though that gets me they look scary but I heard in actuality they are really good - natured with everyone .
I love going to " pay for what you pick " farms . My young son used to eat more blueberries than he put in his pan . I say I ' m going to do that every year and I never do . That sounds like fun . The blueberry plants flower until they get the berries . There are a lot of varieties , but my son could easily pick them because the bushes are short . Strawberry picking is fun too . I love blueberries and strawberries and they seem to taste even better when freshly picked . And I guess it ' s cheaper to pick them yourself too . I actually started because I figured it was cheaper . It is slightly cheaper , but not significantly . I think they secretly build in extra costs to pay for what your kid eats ! That ' s funny , but very true I guess . I would probably be just as bad as a kid my first time and give myself a stomachache . Ha ha ! I was bad my first time , too ! Fruit picking is very social . In face , apple picking used to be a dating ritual in the Midwest , where I live . That ' s an interesting ritual . I used to live near an orchard growing up . Brings back so many memories , but never went berry picking . I regret that now . It ' s never too late to start ! I recommend going early in the morning before it gets too hot .
I just got my first pet Lizards , so I ' m a little crazy over them . It ' s crazy to think over 6 , 000 species of lizards exist . wow that is crazy ! What do you like most about them ? I know and they come in all sizes from tiny geckos to 3 meter " 9 feet " komodo dragons . What ' s not to like ? What type of lizard do you have ? I have chameleon . It ' s interesting watching his sit and wait for his food . OH I bet it is . They also can change colors based on their environment correct ? Have you heard of the Draco , they can jump from trees and glide . I want one ! I haven ' t heard of that one . Unless it ' s the one that has that neck that come puffing out . that is kind of cool looking I think that ' s a desert Lizard . Regardless they are mainly carnivorous just like me .
Auto mechanics fix cars and help keep them working Yes they do ! Have you ever had to deal with them . Sometimes you get ripped off ! Yea their main job is to diagnose the problem but sometimes they lie to make money Yeah its no fun . I heard that even the licenced dealerships will rip people off too . I seen a documentary about it . Yea when they diagnose your car they will say other stuff is broken to make quick cash , very unethical It is . Do you know much about cars ? No i am not good at repairing or diagnosing anything in cars Yeah that ' s too bad . do you know much about bicycles ? No i dont know about either to be honest but im ok with bikes

They have a show coming up in Switzerland on the 1st of July . I hope to one day see them live . They just played in Orlando a few weeks ago , I wanted to go but tickets were super expensive . I would give anything to see them play at Royal Albert Hall again , it ' s such an old venue from like the 1800s .
I just saw a purple cloud . it was so cool . Purple is a color composite of the color violet , often confused for violet but it isn ' t . Is it ? I didn ' t know that . And is that why it is so prety ? It is pretty . Violet is pretty as well but Purple just seems more rich to me . Is purple more rich ? does it cost more money ? I meant rich in shade not in money , because it iis a color intermediate between red and blue . Are those not the same thing . I always wondered ? Purple is similar to violet but purple is a combination of blue and red while Violet is a spectral color that stands on its own . It sure does , and it looks good at night too .
Carrots are definitely one of my favorite vegetables . They taste really good whether they are raw or roasted , which I love . I love them too ! I ' m a big health nut , so I always eat them for their high amounts of alpha and beta - carotene , vitamin K , and vitamin B6 . Oh cool ! So which of those health components are what make them good for your eyesight , the carotenes ? I ' m glad you asked that , because it gives me the opportunity to tell you that it ' s actually a myth that carrots help your eyesight , started by the British in World War II ! Really ? I always thought that the myth was that it helped your eyesight be clearer , but in reality it just improved things like your ability to see in low light over a long period of time . I think it doesn ' t help your eyesight at all , but I could be wrong . Regardless , I do love carrots , even the yellow and purple varieties ! I ' ve only really tried the orange ones . Is there a difference in vitamins or taste with the yellow and purple ones ? Not taste , but there will be a difference in the phytonutrients ( nonvitamin compounds ) present , which are probably responsible for the difference in color .
I love grey ' s anatomy it is an amazing drama tv show probably one of the best tv shows abc has made i think i have heard of that show , is that the one that they perform surgery on cats and dogs ? not exactly , it is a fictional series that focuses on the lives of surgical interns so what do they perform surgery on if not cats and dogs ? they perform surgery on humans the interns try to maintain personal lives and relationship ohhh that show , yea ive seen it . with mcdreamy and such the characters that are in the show include cristina yang , izzie stevens , alex karev

I like the music group the Backstreet Boys Really ? I do not , but I do know they are from Orlando FL , formed in 1993 I don ' t like them as much now , but I listened to them a lot when I was young and they were a new group I do like the Fall Out Boys . They are an old group from Chicago , way back in 2001 . I like them as well . I don ' t think I heard of them though until a few years after that I like NIN , too . Trent Reznor put Nothing Records out of business in 2004 with a lawsuit against John Malm . wow , do you know what the lawsuit was for ? I do not , but they were a vanity label that lets the ' artist ' do stuff , part of Interscope Records . oh ok , I never knew that .
Oh I can ' t wait to retire ! I just want to stop employment completely So , you are ready to quit working ? Have you been doing the same thing for a while ? Unfortunately not however I guess you can consider me semi retired . I ' ve been asking for reduced hours . Ahhh ... so you have been working part time . That can be fun ! You get a little free time throughout the work week . Yeah it ' s been great ! I wish my personal housework and caring for children and pets was also considered paid labour though haha I know what you mean ! That is a full time job all by itself ! So what are you planning to do once you fully retire ? I ' m going to travel around the world !

I didn ' t know that . I guess you learn something new every day .
Do you like to watch Association football ? I can ' t wait for next season . I just started getting into it a few years ago ! I figure , it ' s the world ' s most popular sport so it must be exciting ! I think that ' s the reason over 250 million people play ! It took me a few years to gain interest . Turns out my eyes were going bad once I got glasses I could follow the ball easier . Yes , that would be difficult to see ! Especially when you take into consideration there are eleven players on each team ! There ' s a lot of places for that ball to hide ! Do you know how many countries have teams ? Association Football is played in 200 countries ! Isn ' t that remarkable ? That ' s crazy I ' m guessing some of those places don ' t even have running water but they have an Association football team .
Hello ! I have only bought honda civics in the past , they are my favorite car . Have you ever owned one ? No I have not but some of my friends have owned them .

And apparently Honda is eighth largest automobile manufacturer in the world . They are dependable for sure !
Pancakes are literally the greatest , I love scotch pancakes and drop scones Me too ! Ive been wanting to try some new pancake recipes ive been looking at , Do you know when they invented pancakes ? Thats the thing they are old . evidence suggest that pancakes were the most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies . Oh really ! thats neat , They are after all very easy to make and taste so good !, Did they have syrup back them like we do today ? What did they out on pancakes back then ? No they didn ' t have syrup for a long time after , but pancakes were thin moist and filled with all kinds of nuts and fruits . That sounds great , I guess they had to make them sweeter with fruits instead of syrup so that makes sense . Do you have a favorite pancake flavored syrup ? Nope I love cream cheese , chocolate and ground walnuts all natural !
The Bible is my favorite book . It ' s pretty old , but it has some very interesting stories . The bible is so interesting , its crazy that different Christian groups have such differing attitudes about it ! Yeah ! There ' s so many different interpretations by different Christian groups . I wonder how far back it dates ... I think pretty far since the New Testament has collections of writings in it , written in the first century by Koine Greek That ' s pretty old .

Do you know any groups that are famous for animal rights ? I sure do ! The Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) supports the extensions of legal rights and personhood to animals . They ' re my heroes . Interesting . I heard that in some countries , dolphins are being protected from being shown at marine parks as well . Yep , and the ALF is the type of organization to clandestinely remove those dolphins from being at the marine parks in the first place . Like an animal rights CIA . That ' s really great . I hope they can do the same at all zoos with all animals . That ' s true , except for flamingos . Pretty to look at , but dirty , nasty creatures deserving of their captivity .
As a Blond . I can confirm we do have more fun . I have fair hair with low levels of pigment and I have great life . Oh I bet you do ! Do you ever get tired of the endless blond jokes though ? Nope , I have a high IQ and a good job so I know it ' s not true . I love my hair of yellowish color . It ' s nice to know that the jokes are just jokes and are not true to real life , then . Do you ever color your hair a different color ? Blonde is an Old English term that means faeger - feahs " or blonde hair to define those to the north . No , I ' m Scottish so I like to embrace my heritage . That makes sense , for some reason it ' s easy to picture people exposed to cold and snow to be blond or white haired . Maybe it ' s because everything is white up there ! We get much less sun here . Maybe that has something to do with it . Further south in Italy some say that blonde came from Medieval Latin " blundus ", meaning " yellow " and was also describing those to the far north .

Yeah I do not think I could go back to the MSN Dial - up internet days . Me either . Those days were the worst ! It ' s crazy how much technology has improved over the years .

I wish more animal shelters were no kill shelters dont you ? However many states set the rules within theyre own jurisdiction . i agree with the no kill , I wonder if the federal government can adopt some basic laws for all The Humane Society of the United States is a non profit that tries very hard to push those laws but have not yet been successful in a formal regulation nationwide . but are no kill shelters viable , it seems they would become overrun if they run out of space to house animals They do many times and have to limit the intake because of that . They will only euthanize if the animal is very sick or a great danger to society . its sad they have to , but how can a person like me get involved if there are no shelters were I live Well there is always options like donating money to the ASPCA or a local humane society as it all has the same common goal to save as many animals as possible .

I just love the beach do you know anything about it ' s coral reefs ? well the particles composing a beach are typically made from rock , such as sand , gravel , shingle , pebbles , or cobblestones .

I know a bit about parenting , since even though I don ' t have kids I know how important it is to support children both physically , emotionally , and socially as they are raised . Oh thats good .

Yes , talking about caretaker , myself and my wife are very busy career people , I ' m wondering how we will be able to manage . Do you think hiring a nanny can ease the job ? I guess that depends on if you can afford that and know she is reliable . Those raised in other means like nannies or foster care are a bit iffy . oh ok . I think It means one of us have to focus less on career so that we can raise a healthy child That would be a good idea , since being a good parent is absolutely vital to the child ' s development .

Fox may not be around today if it was not for the Simpsons ! I totally agree with you ! I think it ' s the best show ever Agreed ! It is the longest - running American sitcom and animated program ! Really ? I didn ' t know that

I don ' t have any animals just yet . My schedule is too hectic

It was switched to Pepsi - Cola in 1898 So who is Brad ? The Brad comes from Bradham . He moved from his drug store to a rented warehouse in 19083
I ' ve been on a low carb diet and read about different cuts of beef , and the first cuts are called primal cuts , which I hadn ' t heard of before . how long have you been on the diet ? almost two years , I lost a bout eighty pounds and ju st trying to k eep it off . Those basic sections first cut are what steaks and other subdivisions are cut . oh thats good , what kinds cuts are your favorite ? what do people on this diet typically eat ? Yeah , primal cut is very different than prime cut , or those of higher quality . Mostly low carb foods . I bet this diet can be very pricey . I do eat more vegetables , and they can be pricey , I look for things on sale . On meat , the neck and legs are the toughest , where the muscles are used the most . It gets more tender away from hoof and horn . thats good to know .

I really like Italian cuisine . Its very diverse . It certainly is . Each region , but especially between the North and the South , have their own way of cooking . It ' s all delicious ! I would really like to go to Italy for authentic Italian food . I ' ve been and it ' s amazing . I love how their chefs rely on quality ingredients rather that quantity . The flavors really shine ! Im so jealous . Is there a main ingredient in Italian food ? Well pasta , obviously . Italians also make full use of lots of vegetables and fish , and cook mainly with olive oil . That all sounds fantastic . What kind of dishes should I try out ? It depends where you go . For example , the Naples area specializes in using rural ingredients and seafood . Other regions have their own specialties . Pizza ' s pretty good too ! I love pizza . I bet their tomato sauces are amazing .
I used to work as a janitor at an office building . I worked at night so it was quiet and sort of nice . It ' s hard work . Some janitors do maintenance and security duties in addition to cleaning . Yeah , I was also told to look for anything out of the ordinary as well . I know the work can be physically demanding and sometimes pretty dirty too . Janitors don ' t make enough money ! That is definitely true about the money ! At least is is an honest days work though ! That ' s true ! A similar job is being a building superintendent . They do more managerial work . Oh ! I didn ' t know that is what a building superintendent did ! Do you have to have a college degree for that position ?
I own a sweetheart of a Pit bull and an old American bull dog , I am in love with both of them That sounds awesome . I like all dogs , I heard pit bulls and bull dogs are loyal dogs , might get territorial as well . Not for everyone but they ' re sweet . Yeah it ' s unfortunate but it ' s all in their bloodline . If they were from a lineage that was born to fight , dog fighting is what they want to do . It ' s cruel that people bet against animal violence for fun I agree , there is nothing more cruel than that , people think it ' s somehow fun to make dogs suffer , I hate to see it . I think each owner gets a dog in their own image though as far as character goes . For sure , some people get them to love them , and others like Michael Vick one of the best and highest paid quarterbacks , still didn ' t have enough money so used dog fights for income Making dogs suffer just for money is really cruel , this kind of people has no morals . I have a deer chihuahua so I ' m definitely a dog loving person . They ' re so cute ! I ' ve never heard of a Deer Chihuahua but they are named afrer the state of Chihuahua in Mexico ! Yeah Deer Chihuahuas are closer to original Aztec Techichi ' s which they come from , they ' re a bit bigger than the tiny ones that are popular . And yes They come from Chihuaheno Mountains . They are the smallest breed of dog too ! I love them because they are NATURAL . People keep breeding these poor dogs unnaturally small and it gives them health issues . Chihuahuas are au naturale .
I eat way too many french fries . Some people call them chips in Brattain or finger chips in India . Do you like them ? I do like fries . Why do they have so many different names ? I really don ' t know honestly . They ' re the same thing served hot , soft or crispy and eaten for lunch or dinner . I guess people just gave them different names geographically . That is interesting . What are the best condiments to eat with fries ? I prefer ketchup Ketchup is always a classic for sure . Some more adventurous types will eat them with vinegar , mayonnaise and even other toppings . I ' ve dipped them in ice cream before and it was pretty good . When were fries invented ? I don ' t know if anyone knows to be honest . They were always prepared by cutting and peeling the potatoes , but when it started may be lost in history .
I enjoy indie music because it doesn ' t really fall into a single defined style . I like it to be whatever the artist wants it to be . I also do enjoy it , Ive found a lot of good indie bands on soundcloud . What are some good recommendations of indie artists ? Well , in the 2000s , groups like Arcade Fire , Death Cab for Cutie , and Sonic Youth really enjoyed commercial success . Oh cool , I ' ll have to check them out some time , Was indie music always around or is it a fairly new genre ? Recently . It really started in the UK in the 50s and 60s , when many artists launched independent labels because major labels had too much power . Wow I never knew that , I agree some major labels just own too much music and people are afraid of copyrights and stuff . Yeah , those are definitely major issues . It ' s to the point that indie record labels have 66 % of all music titles . That exist . Anywhere . Wow 66 %, thats insane , I had no idea they were that popular , Do you know if indie artists play at converts ? Of course , alt - rock groups play all over the world all the time . Whether that means they ' re still technically " indie " is kind of debatable because of that .
My parents met at Woodstock , I couldn ' t believe it when they told me . Woodstock is a music and art fair . Yeah , I have seen what it was like on tv , it must have been a good time . It is normally on a diary farm in the mountains . That is interesting . How often did they have it ? Every year , from august 15 - 17 . It is truly great . I bet it gets pretty crowded there , but I ' m sure the music is awesome . It was mostly a rainy weeekend during that time . Well I ' m sure people still had fun there . I have never gone myself , just heard about it from time to time .
I ' ve always wanted to be a debutante ! It is is a girl or young woman of an aristocratic or upper - class family who has reached maturity to come out and debut Welp , I don ' t have an aristocratic or upper - class family , so I guess I ' m out of luck ! At what age do most debutantes have their big , elaborate balls ? normally 18 , Originally , the term meant the woman was old enough to be married Oh , I see ! It seems like debutantes have a lot of history ? Is this an old term ? Well oddly enough In Australia , débutante balls ( or colloquially " deb balls ") are usually organised by high schools Oh really ? So , it sounds more commonplace than in the US ! It kinda is in The Australian debutante wears a white gown Almost like a bride ! It sounds like a beautiful event ! Does each girl get her own deb ball ?

Do you know of any really famous indie artists ? i cant think of any right now but independent labels have a long history of promoting developments in popular music . labels suh as sun records king recods and stax are exmaples of this Oh awesome , I ' ve heard of Sun Records . many british produces and artist launch independent labels as outlets for work and artist they like but majority fail and get swallowed up by majors . pretty sad :( That is unfortunate !
Anime is awesome , love japanese animation I ' m quite the weeb myself so I can agree . anime is the japanese term for animation It ' s really broad so saying you don ' t like it usually makes zero sense . many westerners see anime as only japanese I ' ve never understood that , since it comes from so many different places . well strictly it should only be japanese to be an anime

My friend became vegan to reduce blood pressure . I am actually a vegan for ethical reasons as I oppose the use of animals for any purpose . And if it is beneficial to my body then that helps me even more .

What else you know on it ? China is home to some of the oldest religious philosophies . Buddhism being one . You know , I think I did hear that , pretty sure I did anyway . You know much else on it , this makes for a lively discussion I know that China adheres to three religions , Confuscianism and Taoism being the other two . Now , no clue they had this many .

Yea it has been a pretty long time . I remember watching the first episode with Will Smith . Is Steven Higgins , his sidekick , funny ?
Hello , I just wanted to say first that I grew up in an orphanage and it was not fun . Do you have any opinions on that ? My name is Kevin by the way . Good Morning . I do know orphanges have been closed mostly in Europe and North America . Really ? I wonder why . Do you think its because of money issues or other issues ? I imagine because it is a state funded program in countries abroad . Wow . After all these years i honestly didnt realize it was funded by the state . I wonder if in Europe they are also funded by the state . I spent my childhood in one . Abroad there are a charities that continue to fund orphanages ; however some are funded by smaller charities and religious groups Thats neat . Glad that there are people out there who really care about the children enough to keep them open with charities . I always donate money to a charity every year and I ensure that my money goes to one that does stuff I believe in . If I could find a charity that supports orphanages I will definitely donate to it .
an animal shelter sometimes called a pound is a place for stray , lost , abandoned , or surrendered animals are kept and rehabiltated . sometimes these shelters inclde sick and wounded wildlife as well . I like the no kill shelters . All animals deserve a chance . I ' m an animal lover . well the unfortunate thing in europe 30 countries except four were surveyed and found they permitted the killing of healthy stray dogs . :( Oh that ' s terrible . They should make some kind of incentive for spaying and neutering . Do you know much else about animal shelters ? there is actually no government run organization that provides oversight or regulation of shelters on a national basis in the us . so basically these shelters are unregulated for the most part :/ I didn ' t know that . I feel like there definitely should be some sort of laws or at least monitoring . The government is in everything else . well some positive news many states do regulate shelters within their jurisdiction so while theres no national oversight some states try to do their part when / if they can !
I love being part of the Humane society and donating my time to animals in need . I agree ! I am highly against factory farming , the fur trade , puppy mills , wildlife abuse and animal fighting . Those are all important issues the Humane Society advocates against . It ' s a shame that puppy mills are still a thing and people willingly buy their puppies from them . I wish they would all be shut down . I agree . Puppy Mills are horrible . They value profit over the welfare of the animals . Sometimes Im so saddened by what humans will do for profit . Greed is rampant in this day and age . I feel so sorry for the conditions of the female dogs of the mills , being bred over and over again . Yes , and they often develop mammary tumors from repeatedly having babies without care being given to the mothers . so sad ! Poor things , I wish I could take all of them in . They probably never see medical care at all . I agree , and they often have genetic disorders which cause them to live short lives due to their inbreeding . This not only hurts the dog but breaks the hearts of the people who own them . The owners probably have no idea they are in for that sort of heartache either .

I used to listen to The Strokes a lot back in high school . Their debut album was added to Rolling Stones 500 greatest albums of all time at number 199 . " Is This It ?" is my favorite . Im not surprised . Yeah the album was different for the era . They really tried to capture a simpler rock song that wasnt changed a lot in production .
Going Mountaineering for a breath of fresh air . Yes , it ' s a sport where you climb the mountains and breath really fresh air It can also be done indoors It has broad definitions and alot of activities can be accorded to it , some scholars identify mountaineering - related activities as climbing ( rock and ice ) and trekking up mountains , others are also adding backpacking , hiking , skiing etc yes , that ' s correct . its best for physically agile people . for most scholars it is climbing and trekking .

My favorite song is Barbie Girl by the Danish dance - pop group Aqua . Oh I like that song . When did it come out ? It was released in May , 1997 , and was the bands third single . Oh cool . I don ' t think I know any of their other music . Honestly , this is their only good single , and it was written after one of the band members saw an exhibit in Denver that featured a bunch of barbie dolls . Thats so cool , I never knew that . Yeah , it still remains their biggest single to date . Do you have any idea if it was certified gold or platnum ? No , but it ' s their only hit to come within the top 20 of the " Billboard " Hot 100 .

Last night I had a great 6 oz sirloin steak from Texas Roadhouse . It was pretty good . Are you a steak eater yourself ? I LOVE steak whether it be grilled , broiled , or stir - fried ! I ' ve never eaten at the Texan Roadhouse before . I ' m happy to hear you had a nice steak there ! Yes . Which type your favorite ? Grilled ? Broiled ? I know there are so many ways to cook them and so many types . I prefer a grilled steak that has been marinated and served with a big baked potato ! lol The baked potato is almost a staple with steaks . Although for me , I prefer a fried potato . Fried potatoes , just slightly burnt are great . I also like my steak cooked medium to medium well . I like it a little pink . Oh I adore french fries ! I love them crispy and could basically eat them by themselves as a snack ! I also love my steak medium - slightly pink . I prefer the " steak " fries . A bit larger than french fries . The thing I have come to find about most fast food restaurants is that they do not cook their french fries long enough . They are too soft and not done enough . When I fry them , or when I go to a restaurant like Texas Roadhouse , they are cooked just right . Crispy , even a little burnt is good with me . What do you think ? I ' m totally with you ! I love them crispy - not mushy ! I love big fat steak fries and now you have made me hungry ! lol Well , what type of steak do you like best ? Sirloin ? T - bone ?
Immortality of being exempt from dying sounds pretty great . Yes but I don ' t really understand it , what can you tell me about it ? It would be the absense of aging , but some say it may not mean your immune to disease or physical trauma . So its like eternal life but no aging ? Yes , exactly . Some say it happen to an extent in the not to distant future . I ' ve often heard in church that immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of God . That ' s a very different type of thing , Christian views are different .
I work at Amazon ! its such an amazing place to work for , i ' m very lucky . Do you like the company ? Not really . They are putting all mom and pops out of business . I have not liked them since 1994 when Jeff Bezos started . I can understand that ! I ' m sorry if you or someone you know has been affected . Do you know how much the giant company is worth ? A fair amount . Keep your friends close and your enemy ' s closer . I know they are based in Seattle , Washington and started off as a book store . Its a shame that large companies like amazon feel the need to conquer the market even though they probably had enough money before . People are very greedy . Do you know what we sell at amazon ? You sell everything . You work for the largest Internet retailer in the world and second largest after Alibaba Group in terms of total sales . Ah i ' ve heard of Alibaba , they are the biggest in china , i think . So amazon are doing extremely well . It truly is a shame that they have taken over the market . What else can you tell me about Amazon ? The company makes it ' s own electronics like the Kindle . It ' s like a broke man ' s apple . Have you tried on any of the clothing they make ?
Even though people eat shrimp worldwide , I ' m not one of them since I ' m allergic to them . im not to fond of shrimp I ' ve only tasted one once on accident , because I didn ' t know that a prawn was the same thing as a shrimp when I visited the United Kingdom . my daughter is also allergic to shrimp . the last time she accidentally ate one , she was hospitalized I was hospitalized as well . I had a lot of swelling and shortness of breath , not to mention a very itchy full body rash . i wonder why so many people are allergic to shrimp I don ' t know the exact reason for the number of people , just that the cause is a hypersensitivity of the immune system .
My favorite dish is made with spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs Oh I love pasta ! Do you make your own spaghetti and sauce ? I do and italian writers often make fun of the dish calling it pseudo italian or non italian Well , I consider it Italian . If they don ' t , why not ? How can it not be Italian ? Meatballs in Italy are only served with egg based pasta so the writers made fun of it I like egg noodles , too , but I didn ' t realize there was such discernment ! How do you make your meatballs ? I mix ground beef and pork with egg , onion , bell pepper and bake y meatballs
My youngest son was born with a visual impairment which means his ability to see has been decreased and he will need glasses . Oh wow does the visual impairment have a name ?

Some service dogs are bred by trainers and others are trained by specialized organizations .
I been feeling the weight of the years lately , I am getting older and it makes me sad . Yes , same here . It is tough dealing with the aging process and slower reaction times . Our knowledge does continue to grow ! Yeah that is a positive point , besides we get wiser as time goes by . Yes , hopefully scientists can figure out why two - thirds of humans die from age - related causes . Who knows , maybe we can benefit from that research before its too late That ' s true . So perhaps scientists will figure out how to reverse the process of becoming older and regenerate cells faster . Do you know if this research is on advanced stages ? Every species has the ability to regenerate cells , but not sure how advanced scientists are on humans rather than other animals or bacteria at this point . Well Im sure many advancements will be made in the future .
When I was a child my parents separated . It was the worst feeling in the world . Oh , yes divorce is so sad , the dissolution of marriage and termination of marital union just makes me cry . How long do you think it takes to really get over something like that Oh , it depends on the person , some people can never really get over it . Especially if the reasons for the divorce were mutual or if someone wasn ' t sexually faithful ! How many people do you think cheat on their spouses in a given year ? I bet it is a lot . Oh , I have no clue , probably a lot like you said ! But if they weren ' t cheating than the couple could file for an annulment , which declares the marriage as null , instead of a divorce What are the ramifications of an annullment ?

gosh i ' m such a perfectionist ! in psychology it ' s a personality trait Some might call it something other than a trait . like what ? I just strive for flawlessness and i set high performance standarts I believe there are maladaptive forms , where people try to achieve unattainable or unrealistic goals . maybe so . in the end , we derive pleasure from reaching our goals Pressuring oneself to achieve unrealistic goals sets a person up for disappointment . They tend to be harshly critical of themselves . when they fail unless we don ' t fail ;) but the truth is when we don ' t reach our goals we can easily fall into depression True , those who strive for excellence but can use mistakes as an incentive to work harder . but noraml perfectionists are more inclined to pursue perfection without compromising self - esteem

The reading process fascinates me it is a complex cognitive process ! What do you mean exactly ? Reading is about decoding symbols in order to construct and derive meaning , this is also known as reading comprehension . oh ok yea its pretty interesting that our brains can do that Right , in addition its really thrilling because reading requires creativity and critical analysis . yea i definitely agree When you consume literature you have to venture into each new piece and inately derive from the literal world complex images that make sense in new and unfamiliar text . yea i see what you mean There are no concrete laws while reading , it allows you and each individual an opportunity to escape and produce their own introspection .

You could always bleach it and then color the bleached hair red . No , I think the only time I will try to dye my hair is when it ' s gray . I think it damages my hair when I do .

No I haven ' t , but I heard that is a much healthier alternative . They have some lovely red shades too .
My mom used to read me fairy tales every night before bed . I always loved being told fairy tales , my favorites involved eleven , trolls and dragons . Oh yeah ! I loved a good story with a Prince and a Princess . Fairy tales were often used to describe a happy ending to the story or a fairy tale romance . Cool ! I love how magical I always thought they were as a child . The Brothers Grimm were some of the best story tellers of their time and are responsible for most stories we know today like cinderella , snowwhite and sleeping beauty I have heard of them before ! My favorite fairy tail was always Cinderella . There are actually many different versions of the cinderella story from different countries .

What do you think about chicken ? I LOVE chicken . Especially crispy fried chicken ! Cool . I love to eat chicken as well . I had a pet chicken as a child though . So does that mean you don ' t eat chicken as a source of food then ? I do actually ! In fact , the reason I had the pet chicken was because when we moved into the farm house they had removed all the chicken that were there before we lived there . However , this one chicken had hidden behind the chicken coop door . The previous people made a deal with me over the course of a few months that they would give me a kitten if I gave them their chicken . I accepted because I didn ' t have much of a choice as a child and farm life is different than city life . Anyway , they said I had fattened it up well and it was the best chicken they ever ate . hahaha that is the most bizarre story I ' ve ever heard . I bet they made chicken and waffles lol ! I don ' t think they knew about chicken and waffles in that part of the world , but maybe ... :) What part of the world is that ? I ' m from the south and soul food is the best !

How do you feel about christianity . which has the messiah as the focal point of their faith I don ' t know a whole lot about it . I was raised Catholic but don ' t practice anything now . It is the worlds largest religion apparently with over 2 . 4 billion followers or 33 % of the population known as christians Interesting . I didn ' t think christianity was an actual religion . yeah me either . they believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament Isn ' t that similar to the Catholic religion ? I am not sure . I don ' t know much about Catholicism . It says that Christianity has played a prominent role in shaping of Western civilization I believe that .

I have a pet Pug named corky :) He ' s the cutest ! I love pugs , I like them for their fine , glossy coat , they come in a variety of colours , most often fawn or black , and they have a cute square body with lots of muscles . I love them too ! Mine is black . Where did the breed originate from ? If my memory serves me correctly , Pugs were actually brought from China to Europe in the 16th century and were very popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands , and the House of Stuart . Woah ! I didn ' t realize they had that much history ... Corky must have been royalty ! Haha . Indeed they were , I bet they were popular because Pugs are well known for being really sociable and gentle companion dogs and they are good around kids . Awww , my Corky does have a very gentle temperament . I just love their cute snouts .
I ' ve always wanted to go to Iceland . Have you ever been ? I ' ve never been before . Isn ' t that an island located in Europe ? Do you plan to go soon ? No , I ' m afraid to fly . If I could ever get over the fear I would go . It ' s too bad that they can ' t build a long bridge to get there for people like you . Maybe the fact that the island is volcanic makes that a good idea to not travel there . Yeah probably . I like experiencing new places . See things I ' ve never seen . As long as I can drive lol It ' s crazy that the first settlement on Iceland dates back to 874 . That ' s a long time ago ! I wonder what they ate back then ..? Yes that is a very long time ago . I imagine the things they ate back then were trial and error . Probably like , oh this looks good lets see if we can eat it without being poisoned . . That ' s true . Being surrounded by water makes me think a lot of seafood . I bet they had some good farming land for when they Norwegians first arrived . Yes , I ' d say they ate a lot of fish .

Any toppings you want , really . Traditional New York Style pizza just has tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese though . Is it only popular in New York , or in other places as well ? It ' s actually popular in a lot of neighboring states , like new Jersey and Connecticut , but it ' s also very popular in other states , including here in Florida ! Wow , I ' m located in Texas , so that ' s why I ' m not familiar with it . Who invented the New York style pizza ? I ' m not sure who invented it , but the first pizzeria to ever open in the United States was opened by Gennaro Lombardi in New York in 1905 .
Rita Hayworth is my dream woman ! you mean was ? she was an american actress and dancer that died in 1987 Yes , I just meant that I want whoever I fall in love with to be just like her . She may be gone but her charm and beauty lives on . Well thats understandable , she achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era ' s top stars , appearing in a total of 61 films over 37 years . Wow thats a lot , do you know which film was considered her best ? she is best known for her performance in the 1946 film noir , " Gilda " I ' ll have to wholeheartedly agree with that , it was an amazing film . some people called her the Love Goddess to describe hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s I ' ll agree with that too , she ' s definitely a goddess !
Hi . Have you heard of open relationships ? I wish my boyfriend didn ' t want one . That is upsetting that he wants ojne and you dont I agree .

The idea has been recognized since the 1970s That makes sense . Right after the 60 ' s .
Divorce seems to be running rampant these days . The bonds of matrimony seem less meaningful than ever before . I definitely agree . People jump into getting married , that ' s why . You don ' t know someone after 6 months , or even a year ! My girlfriend and I have been dating for several years . Of course she wants to get married , but I take that commitment very seriously . I ' m trying to make sure everything is in order to set us up for success before I take the plunge . I think that is a great idea . My boyfriend and I have been living together for 8 years now . I am still learning new things about him daily . We hope to get married someday , but no rush because neither of us want to get divorced . Totally on the same page . Divorce laws also scare me . She and I are both working professionals and the thought of the monetary and legal implications of divorce have me treading lightly . It ' s just that prenups aren ' t exactly romantic . Definitely ! I never understood a prenup . I always thought it showed lack of faith that things would work out . You would always have it looming over your head . Agreed . Although I ' ve always thought that a simple prenup with a binding arbitration agreement would be prudent . In other words : if we get divorced , we agree not to take it to court and to settle it between ourselves .
Do you like to read ? Yes , I do like to read . It is the process of decoding symbols in order to derive meaning . That ' s right . I was thinking of picking up the second mistborn book and finishing the series . I haven ' t read Mistborn myself but heard they are fantasy novels written by Brandon Sanderson . Yeah , he wrote wheel of time too I believe . His first book was awesome . Actually The Wheel of Time was written by James Oliver Rigney , using his pen name Robert Jordan . Oh yeah that ' s right . Yeah what else has Brandon Sanderson wrote ?
I grew up in the south and my grandmother always made fried chicken for Sunday lunch . Do you like fried chicken ? Heck yea ! I ' m from Louisville , so I gotta get down with some KFC ! 2nd biggest fast food chain ! I live about a block from KFC and I love the chicken bowl . lol Double Down is the cats pajamas , though . Bacon , cheese , and chicken as the " bread !" What exactly is the double down ? lol Gotta admit ... you have me interested with the bacon , cheese and chicken for bread ! Think of a sandwich , where instead of pieces of bread , there are fried chicken filets , and the filler is ooey - gooey cheese and bacon . You sold me ! I am officially hungry ! lol
So way back when , in the Mesolithic period even , most humans obtained food by fishing . were they running around with dinos back then ? Not quite , but that would have been funny ! Like Flintstones , Dinos were Mesozoic . This was Mesolithic , sounds close though . It falls between Paleolithic and Neolithic ! yea thats what i was thinking about , the flinstones . what types of fish did they have back then Catfish and Tilapia for sure , I hear mullets were even worshiped ! oh that sounds yummy I ' m sure a diet in fish was good back then , protein for a harder life ! yea , with some alcohol on the side , if they knew how to make it back then ! I ' m sure they did , I think imbibing in spirits has been around forever . Just looked different I ' m sure .
My parents were divorced when I was around 10 - that means that they terminated their marriage . It was hard on my sister and I . Divorce is roughest on the kids . I am glad that states have made it easier to get divorced , with many allowing " no - fault " dissolutions . The laws do seem to vary around the world but most countries do require the sanction of the courts to help resolve a lot of the issues that come up . Amazing to think that some places divorce is illegal . I shudder to think what it must be like to be trapped like that . At least in the US the courts can kinda step in and help figure out all the child custody , support , visitation , property and debt issues . Sometimes it is necessary for the judge to decide those issues when the parents can ' t work it out . And there are so many reasons for divorce , I think one of the biggest can be a personality clash .
I love the sound of a guitar riff coming thru a huge amplifier . Wouldnt you agree ? Yeah same . The fretted instrument with six strings sounds nice . It looks very hard . I ' m currently learning piano . I know how to play a few songs on a guitar . Mainly Nirvana and Metallica . Whos your favorite guitarists ? Oh nice . I was actually just listening to nothing else matters by tthe american heavy medal band . I also like nirvanna . I Nothing Else Matters has some amazing guitar riffs . Yeah it really does . I honestly listen to like almost every genre , but haven ' t like heavily explored rock enough to be honest . I like The unforgiven and where i may roam and sad but true among others a lot . The Master of Puppets is a must listen to if your exploring Metallica . I love their gutarists Gibson guitar .
My parents divorced when I was young because of a personality clash That has got to be tough . My parents are still together so I dont have much experience with divorce . It ' s a dissolution of marriage thereby dissolving the bonds of matrimony . It ' s a difficult process ! I have heard that a divorce can take a while . Im guessing it has to go through the legal process at court ? Yes , it does need the sanction of a court especially regarding alimony and child custody . Yea I forget about that when I think about divorces . It can get quite complicated when there ' s so many things to settle , like child support , distribution of property , and division of debt .
