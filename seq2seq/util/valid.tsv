But there is always algae in the water . <eou> I love living next to the sea as it moderates Earth ' s climate and plays a very important roll in the cycle of carbon , nitrogen and water . <eou> That ' s why I think we need to be more aware of the health of our ocean because it does play such a big role in the overall environment . <eou> I totally agree as well ; many many times I take a bag with me just to pick up what others have left behind on the beach to help wildlife sustain a living space free of trash . <eou> 	That ' s a good idea , I ' ve never thought of that .

I have always wanted a pet skunk . I ' m not sure if that ' s a good idea though . <eou> It certainly seems risky as the animals are known for their ability to spray a liquid with a strong , unpleasant smell . <eou> Can you get their sprayer fixed so it can ' t do that anymore ? <eou> I ' m not sure honestly , and that seems kind of unethical in my opinion . I do know that skuns are omnivorous , meaning they eat both plant and animal material . <eou> You have a good point . That wouldn ' t be very nice . Probably not a good idea for a pet . I didn ' t know they were omnivorous either . <eou> I ' m glad you agree , I also read that all skunks are striped , even from birth , how neat is that ? <eou> That is really neat . I guess it ' s better just to learn about them than to keep them in captivity . I ' m glad I asked . <eou> 	That seems like a reasonable attitude , even though we think of skunks as only black and white , some are actually brown , cream , or even ginger colored , how cool .	skunk idea pet <eou> strong spray liquid animals risky <eou>  <eou> animal plant opinion meaning <eou>  <eou> neat read <eou> guess captivity neat learn glad <eou>  <expand> ginger cool black attitude white actually brown cream reasonable skunks colored <index> 26
Lady Gaga is so weird but interesting as well , since she is so well known for her provocative and unconventional work . <eou> I frankly must have been sleeping through her rise to fame . <eou> I know what you mean . Also even if she is weird , she started off like any small singer performing at open mic nights and school plays . <eou> Well that is a good story . I ' m afraid that I must live under a rock though . Like Patrick from Spongebob ! <eou> Have you never heard of her at all ? She has topped the US charts many times . <eou> Well sure I have , but I couldn ' t pick her out of a crowd other than that I expect she dresses ridiculously . <eou> That ' s fair enough , it ' s really impressive that someone so strange can make tracks that are so popular that they sell over a million songs in less than a week on iTunes . <eou> 	How lucrative !

I love The Beatles , Love Me Do is one of my favorite songs of theirs , made all the way back in late 1962 . <eou> The Beatles are a classic , when did they first form ? <eou> I believe they formed in Liverpool in 1960 . <eou> Such a long time ago , arguably the biggest band of all time , had such a massive impact on the music industry . Who was your favorite member ? <eou> It has to be Ringo Starr , who didn ' t join until 1962 after they tried a few other drummers , guess he was that good they knew he was the one . <eou> Im a John Lennon guy myself , tragic what happened to him , sadly we have some sick and twisted people in this world . <eou> It is quite sad , mental illness is quite the big topic nowadays given our current culture . I was quite fond the songwriting partnership he formed with McCartney myself . <eou> My favorite of theirs is probably A Day in the Life , they wrote so many famous songs . <eou> Their popularity is certainly enermous , it ' s not wonder it was called Beatlemania , it really was like a mania . <eou> 	Yea it might be a while till we see a band of that impact on the industry .	late love songs <eou> form <eou> believe <eou> industry band time music <eou>  <eou> sick sadly people <eou> mental culture <eou> famous <eou> called mania wonder popularity <eou>  <expand> band till industry impact <index> 28

Comic books are a publication that has sequential panels that represent individual scenes . <eou> Sounds interesting !

I had no idea they ' ve been around that long . I ' ll bet those early Japanese ones were beautiful ! <eou> Yeah , one of the main things that comic books rely on is their organization <eou> I ' ll bet there are a lot of great stories !

As much as I love cooking and have a TON of fun doing it , I don ' t think I ' d cut it on a shop like Top Chef . <eou> Yes I love that show , I really love how it has lots of chefs competing against each other in various culinary challenges . It makes it more interesting . <eou> And there ' s usually a required ingredient , which is something insane like beer or lemons or something . Why are these shows so popular ? <eou> People just like food shows , Top Chef actually got so popular that they made another show called '' Top Chef Junior '' , It features ypung contestants in their early teens , It was premiered in October 2017 on Universal Kids . <eou> Yeah I try to avoid watching that one , because I don ' t need to feel like my childhood was worthless compared to these kids who can already cook better than me . <eou> Indeed , some people I know dont like that show , But it can make kids more interested in cooking and get into a culinary work for their career . <eou> That ' s the hope at least , right ? I feel like most of the time the way it plays out is that kids just want to get in the way in the kitchen . <eou> 	Yep , I know that numerous international adaptations of '' Top Chef '' have also been produced , Thats pretty crazy , just goes to show you how popular it is overseas .	shop cooking love cut <eou> lots chefs culinary love <eou> ingredient insane popular <eou> food popular <eou> try cook feel childhood kids <eou> culinary people cooking kids <eou> plays feel hope kids time kitchen <eou>  <expand> international overseas crazy numerous goes adaptations pretty produced popular <index> 31
Heavy metal music has roots in blues and acid rock . <eou> I have never heard of acid rock , what is that ?

Think LSD too lol <eou> Ah okay , that makes more sense then . Are you a fan of the genre at all ? <eou> Heavy metal , not much , nor Acid Rock . I ' m not too familiar with either personally . <eou> I understand that , Heavy rock is as far as I go , anything past that feels a bit too '' edgy '' I guess <eou> Yeah , Heavy Metal is very aggressive , at least I feel that way personally . <eou> 	That is true , even the Christian Metal is pretty heavy and suicidal	rock metal acid music <eou> rock acid metal <eou> rock guitars <eou>  <eou>  <eou> sense genre <eou> metal <eou> rock feels understand <eou> personally feel aggressive <eou>  <expand> pretty true heavy <index> 32

I love me some Netflix ! Do you like it ? <eou> Yeah I love Netflix , which is an American company . <eou> Yes , and they sure have became very popular . I bet they are in the top of their league , compared to other companies ? <eou> Netflix really took the lead over other companies like Blockbuster . <eou> Yes , and I think they are pretty much out of business almost everywhere now . I imagine they may be doing better than Dish Network and Direct TV too ? <eou> They must be , since cable is dying .

In some institutions a bachelors degree is a graduate degree not an undergraduate degree . <eou> For real ? How does that even work ? <eou> The student can ' t start a bachelor degree until a first degree has been completed , probably like an AA . <eou> And then when applying for jobs do you think it makes a difference ? Like I want to get a master ' s so I ' ll be slightly more valuable to potential employers . <eou> Really depends on your profession , in some cases a masters degree can make you too valuable and companies wont hire you , in most cases its a good thing to have a masters though . what are you trying todo ? <eou> Well I ' m a biologist by training , but I really want to work at the CDC . I was thinking about getting a master ' s in microbiology because just a four year degree isn ' t usually enough for these government agencies . <eou> masters should definitely help , its sounds counter intuitive but if you go for a phd it can make it easier to get your schooling for free . at least it does in engineering <eou> I actually thought about pursuing a PhD after college , but I felt that I wasn ' t smart enough to get into any labs . <eou> if you can get into a masters program , it shouldnt be too hard to get into a lab just got ta network and get in with the right people . <eou> 	That ' s probably true .

Sculpting or sculpture is a branch of the fine arts . It is visual in nature , and it operates in three dimensions . Do you know much about sculture ? <eou> No I don ' t but I would like to know more <eou> The sculptural process originally was performed in two ways . First was carving ; that is , the removal of material from a block of wood or stone , for example . The second way is modelling , which is the addition of material -LRB- clay for example -RRB- on another material . <eou> sounds very cool please tell me more about it <eou> In the early period of sculpting , such as the classical period , for the most part materials were limited to stone , metal , ceramics , and wood . However , since '' Modernism , '' the materials used are almost limitless . <eou> Very interesting is there anything else I should know about scultping ? <eou> If you are interested in sculpting , and you want it to stand the test of time , the best material to use is stone . Other materials , such as wood , perish quite quickly in the process of time . Sculpting with pottery is your second best option if you find stone too difficult to sculpt . <eou> 	Good info thanks a lot for sharing	branch sculpture nature fine <eou>  <eou> removal process addition material block clay stone wood example <eou> please tell <eou> materials stone ceramics metal period wood sculpting <eou> else <eou> stand materials process option difficult test quickly material sculpt stone pottery wood sculpting time <eou>  <expand> thanks lot sharing info <index> 47

Hi , I know far too little , but have always been interesting in Bible study . <eou> To start off , the Bible is pretty much just a record of the relationship between humans and God . <eou> I believe it also to be a guide for the best way to live our lives . <eou> Many different authors contributed to the Bible with their sacred scriptures . <eou> I totally agree . Though many would disagree , the Bible is the Only book that contains absolutely No contradictions . <eou> There is some disagreement among different denominations . Protestants focus on scripture alone , while roman catholics stress harmony . <eou> This is true . I personally do not believe in denominations . Christ established His church .

How often do you actually find new ones worth collecting ? <eou> I was just about to say , I haven ' t found many new stamps to collect these days in the age of email and digital shipping labels . <eou> I figured things would get a lot harder for people who collected stamps , I mean it makes sense . What are some of your favorite stamps ? <eou> My favorite stamp , my most prized stamp is one they made for Calvin and Hobbes as part of a series on newspaper comics . It is one of the only officially licensed pieces of Calvin and Hobbes merchandise , ever . <eou> Holy cow ! That ' s so sweet ! Having those prized possessions definintely makes hobbies a lot more enjoyable ! <eou> I might want to see if I can scare up a few more copies of the stamp , just for posterities sake .

I am not yet a parent , but it will be interesting to raise a child and learn good parenting skills . I ' d like to be a '' good parent '' . <eou> I am not a parent yet either but I couldn ' t agree more I definitely think it is important to try and be the best parent you can be ! <eou> Parenting seems like a process of predictable sequences , but they may turn out different for each child . <eou> That ' s a good point , I guess every child is different so they probably each deal with parenting styles differently . <eou> I ' ve heard that the quality of parenting likely matters more than the amount of time spend with the child . <eou> I guess it is the time you spend with them that counts , having to make the time really important and really appreciating the years you have with them ! <eou> That ' s very true . In some cases , society also plays an important role in raising a child as well . <eou> That ' s true also , I sometimes worry the world we are living in now will be detrimental to the way children are raised . Those so much in the world that can have such huge impacts . <eou> I agree , it is hard .

Everywhere i went today , people kept mentioning beer . When you are a recovering alcoholic like me , you don ' t want people mentioning your weakness all of the time . <eou> Man , that is tough . And good on you for staying strong . Too many people do too many stupid things on alcohol -- driving drunk , risky decisions ... too much . <eou> My wife says my weakness is english grammer , but i know it is alcohol . I sometimes crave a drink around holidays , <eou> Understandable . It ' s supposed to be '' festive '' , right ?! And no doubt on the grammar , as alcohol makes a beeline for the brain -LRB- and other organs , like the heart , liver , pancreas ... ! -RRB- <eou> Yes , alcohol will kill you . i used to be a scotch drinker , because scotch is not measured by the shot . Scotch is a free pour , so you get half a water glass worth . That is about 3 shots for the same price as a shot of Tequila . <eou> Ah , well , and there you hit on my preferred tipple . Tequila . And I had no idea about scotch ! So how do you stay true to * not * drinking ? <eou> Drinking makes it hard to type , so i was forced to choose between using the internet or drinking . Hopefully i made the right choice . <eou> You know what ? I ' m cheering for you . Obviously your brain is way to beautiful to waste . -LRB- And the spectre of cirrhosis , increased risk of cancer , etc ... . good motivation -RRB- <eou> Thanks . If you try scotch , stay away from the blends like Johnny Walker , they are like jet fuel . Many of the single malt scotches are quite nice and drinkable . <eou> Roger that . I ' ve got Scot in my blood , so I ' m thinking my body would rebel against anything less than a single malt . <eou> 	Scotch is like Tequila .

Do you feel that a family can afford to live on minimum wage ? I have mixed feelings <eou> It is absolutely possible , it is just that it requires strong self control and good financial behaviors . Generally though , people who have self control and good financial mindsets can do better than minimum wage . <eou> I agree . I feel like living at such a low wage has so many drawbacks people need to figure something else out <eou> Agreed .

I like listening to records , some people call them vinyl or vinyl records . <eou> Is that your favorite way to listen ? <eou> I like the LP the best , I like how it is made of shellac because prior records were scratchy and thick . <eou> How does it compare to digital sound ? <eou> Digital sound is really clean , but there is a nice way that the record sounds . <eou> How is the sound produced ? <eou> Well , to tell you the truth , I think it is because of sound vibrations , soundwaves that are recorded by some sort of etching ? Maybe it can be impressed too , and it is onto a rotating disk then it is called a record . <eou> That ' s what I thought .

I love pizza ! Especially fresh pizza . Frozen pizza just doesn ' t taste the same . <eou> I agree with you for the most part . I like Home Run Inn frozen pizza but that ' s the only frozen one I enjoy thus far . <eou> I ' ve never had it . Growing up , my dad used to buy us Ellio ' s Pizza . They were founded in 1963 in Long Island , NY . <eou> OK that has to be good , I ' m assuming that is fresh NY style pizza ? I used to live in Chicago and at that time I had some good Chicago style pizza . <eou> Actually , it was frozen pizza . It was '' 9 slices '' of pizza in a box comprising 3 rectangular pizzas , each divisible crosswise into three slices . I will still buy it from time to time just because it reminds me of my dad . I am not a fan of Chicago pizza . <eou> That sounds like it came with a bunch of pizza . I like bulk pizza like that which can feed a family .

It ' s usually topped with additional vegetables or meats , but I prefer mine with French Fries on top . <eou> That ' s interesting , I have never had french fries on my pizza . I like supreme style with stuffed crust preferably . <eou> Ah , so I guess you prefer Pizza Hut .

It scares me a bit . <eou> I would guess there has been some fear since The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903 <eou> I think they have done a lot to alleviate fears since then though ! <eou> Perhaps . Many airplanes are designed to be remotely or computer - controlled these days . <eou> 	I can ' t decide if that makes me feel safer or not !

My son joined Boy Scouts and I have volunteered to help the troop . I am new to Boy Scouts . <eou> That ' s pretty cool ! Boy Scouts is one of the largest private youth organizations in the US <eou> It seems rather expensive with all of the equipment we need to purchase . Will my son be a better man after graduating from Boy Scouts ? <eou> I ' m sure he will be ! He will learn a lot . Their goal is to train youth in responisble citizenship and character development <eou> My son needs that ! I have looked at the training materials , and it appears that i will need to put about 30 hours a week into this project . After work i am tired . i ' m not sure i can commit to this . <eou> Have you ever thought about getting an au pair ? Au pair is a nanny / helper from a different country who will live with you and could help you with your son and other stuff <eou> We had one , but my wife hated her . I thought she was great . My wife said the au pair had to go or she was . I think i made the wrong choice . Maybe i will enroll my son in Karate classes . That is only one hour a week . <eou> Maybe instead of au pair you could find a nanny . She could take him to karate or boy scouts events and provide a child care <eou> 	Yes , you are right . I am going to look for a '' girlfriend '' to be a nanny for my son . I believe he will like that , and I will too .

I used to play a lot of Halo . I always thought the Master Chief to be an intriguing character . <eou> I didn ' t care for halo , but my wife loved it . <eou> Once 343 industries took over from Bungie with Halo 4 , I think it lost its magic . <eou> I ' m not surprised . That happens to a lot of games . <eou> Do you know Cortana ? The artificial intelligence from Halo . <eou> Yeah , I remember her . <eou> I always liked the unusual relationship between Cortana and the Master Chief . It added a strange bit of company to the misery of lonliness that the story sometimes creates . <eou> It was a true story for the ages . <eou> Maybe .

The film ended up still being over 3 hours long <eou> Oh , that ' s good to know , since that ' s so long . Interesting . What else do you know about it ? <eou> The film was delayed for over two years because the producer was determined to have Gable star in it <eou> 	Ahh . So that makes sense .

I love to read - it ' s such a great escape - do you ? <eou> I completely agree . Reading is such a fun , enjoyable thing to do . It also is nice in that it helps share information and ideas . This will help progress our society so that we can learn from our mistakes .

Karen Kingsbury is probably my favorite author of that genre . <eou> Her first book '' Missy ' s Murder '' is a favorite of mine . I can ' t believe that it was written all the way back in 1991 . Do you know about the murder story that it was based on ? <eou> I don ' t think I ' ve read that one as our library leaves a bit to be desired in this area . <eou> Ahh you should defintely check for it . Libraries should provide a place for creativity and analyzing things critically . All people should give reading a chance . <eou> I completely agree - and I love watching my girls just devour books now also <eou> 	It ' s good that our taxes go towards things like public libraries so that children get a spot to read .

A lot of teenagers get pregnant these days , it is also known as adolescent pregnancy that occurs in females under 20 years old <eou> Why do you think it happens more frequently nowadays ? <eou> I think their upbringing is the major cause , maybe the parents that raised them didnt play their role well <eou> I feel sorry for the young kids as the parents at that age most times are not mature enough . Is there any programs out there trying help educate these young individuals ? <eou> i think there a lot of foundations and programs educating teenagers on teenaage education <eou> Is the rate higher in depending on the demographics ? <eou> yes i think it is , but Teenage pregnancy in developed countries is usually outside of marriage , and carries a social stigma in many cultures and groups <eou> That must be awful for the teens . Which country has the highest rate of teen pregnancy ? <eou> i think America has the highest rate because according to research conducted In 2014 , 249 , 078 babies were born to women between 15 - 19 years old <eou> I ' m amazed by that .

Maybe a wave pool would be a good place to try it out . There are no sharks in there ! <eou> Or you can try body boarding .

It must be hectic working in an emergency room though , right ? <eou> Well , specialized hospitals are available to potentially reduce healthcare costs . <eou> I wish our healthcare costs would go down , but I don ' t see it happening . Do you think that pay is generally better in general or specialized hospitals ? <eou> A district hospital is usually the biggest one in its region , with vast amount of beds for intensive care and long term care . <eou> I ' ve never even heard of a district hospital .

Do you read the newspaper ? I do occasionally , but just don ' t think about it with the computer and all <eou> Newspapers are important instutions .

It ' s like my husband supporting the Miami Dolphins , even though they are useless -LRB- he ' s from Miami -RRB- . <eou> Who knows why anyone support these losing teams ?

Even though I personally don ' t really believe in God , the whole prospect of God and religion has always been sort of interesting . <eou> It is very interesting . I share the same thought about God as you . What do you find most interesting ? <eou> One part that is interesting is that older civilizations used God -LRB- s -RRB- to explain certain natural processes , like the Sun rising . <eou> Does that come from people needing to explain the unexplained ? <eou> Pretty much , unexplained things scare people so they need to explain them to put themselves at ease . Especially back then with limited scientific knowledge . <eou> Do you know what made people start believing in only one god ? <eou> I believe that much of it is due to the rise of Christianity , which is the most popular monotheistic religion ever and still is . <eou> You know a lot about this subject .

I just bought mine from the breeder and didn ' t think too much about where they came from . <eou> You choosing dogs as pets is wise . Dogs being associated with humans has encouraged them to become uniquely attuned to human behavior , which has led them to be so much more better suited to co - exist and be pets with humans over other canid species . <eou> Yes , mine always seem to know when I am getting sick and they spend time with me . <eou> I ' m glad to hear it .

I always felt that being a vegetarian was the right thing to do . <eou> Do you feel that way because of sentient life ? <eou> I always felt that going out of our way to kill other mammals that god put on this planet was something he would not approve of .

I don ' t know what I ' ve been missing by not eating steak sooner in my life . I love that there are so many different kinds of cuts of steak to enjoy , too ! Skirt steak , flank steak , silverfinger steak . I have much to catch up on . <eou> Can you tell me more about how to cook steak ? <eou> It ' s a big process of discovering how you like it , and what ' s easiest for you . Generally , it ' s grilled because people want to replicate the certain flavor that comes about when it ' s cooked over the coals of an open fire . But you have other options , like cooking it in sauce -LRB- e . g . in a steak and kidney pie -RRB- , or putting it into patties for hamburgers . Up to the user ! <eou> Is steak limited to just beef or is there such a thing as chicken steak and stuff like that ? / <eou> The word usually refers to beefsteak ; but absolutely , yes , there can be other kinds , like fish steak , or steak from bison , camel , goat , kangaroo , ostrich , reindeer , zebu , horse ... and the list goes on . It ' s kind of a catch - all term . <eou> Interesting , let ' s discuss a different food idea , like eggs for instance . How do you like to prepare your eggs ? <eou> Me personally ? I ' m a poached egg kind of guy . I like eggs cooked outside of the shell by it being poached / steamed , so that it ' s more delicately cooked . I love them just as much as I love steak because of the protein they provide , which is great for your diet . <eou> Sorry I meant food item not food idea . I ' ve never tried poached eggs , I ' m more a hard - boiled person , but it seems like a novel cooking method . <eou> Give it a shot ! It ' s easy , but you have to be precise and paying attention . Mainly you ' re cracking an egg into a cup / bowl , then sliding that into a pan of water that ' s heated to 75 degrees celsius , cooking it until the egg white is mostly solid but with a soft yolk -- that ' s key . You want a runny yolk with a slightly hardened crust , but no raw white . <eou> 	Sounds like a detailed process , but I ' ll give it a shot , thanks for informing me about it .	catch steak enjoy life love eating ve flank <eou> tell steak cook <eou> grilled process flavor pie fire hamburgers cooked steak user cooking comes sauce people easiest kidney <eou> steak limited chicken beef stuff <eou> usually beefsteak camel term ostrich steak horse list goat fish <eou> idea food prepare eggs <eou> guy shell steak provide poached personally protein diet cooked egg eggs <eou> idea person item food boiled method poached cooking hard eggs <eou> raw re yolk precise runny cup heated degrees 75 slightly easy shot cracking solid sliding hardened bowl paying attention white cooking pan soft water crust key egg <eou>  <expand> process informing ll thanks shot detailed <index> 612

But they re - launch each comic every few years , so there ' s always a good jumping - on point . <eou> 	Well , I think you ' ve convinced me .

Have you read any good horror fiction lately ? <eou> I have , actually ! I love horror fiction . keeps me feeling invigorated . Just like historian J . A .

Are there any other authors you like ? <eou> 	Oddly enough , what always seems to be a fun read is finding European horror fiction from way back , as in Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans . things like Greek mythology with Prometheus , who was a titan , etc .

I hope you are doing well .

From what you are telling me , it seems more for amusement -LRB- theater -RRB- than history . What about other wars that the US was part of . Even the American Revolution does not see as much reenactment . <eou> there are reenactments of all of the wars , the Civil War being most popular because it was fought on US soil , and it was US against US , the biggest popularity came between the 80 ' s and 90 ' s <eou> Have you ever attended a reenactment . I have not ?

I love going to '' pay for what you pick '' farms . My young son used to eat more blueberries than he put in his pan . <eou> I say I ' m going to do that every year and I never do . That sounds like fun . <eou> The blueberry plants flower until they get the berries . There are a lot of varieties , but my son could easily pick them because the bushes are short . Strawberry picking is fun too . <eou> I love blueberries and strawberries and they seem to taste even better when freshly picked . And I guess it ' s cheaper to pick them yourself too . <eou> I actually started because I figured it was cheaper . It is slightly cheaper , but not significantly . I think they secretly build in extra costs to pay for what your kid eats ! <eou> That ' s funny , but very true I guess . I would probably be just as bad as a kid my first time and give myself a stomachache . <eou> Ha ha ! I was bad my first time , too ! Fruit picking is very social . In face , apple picking used to be a dating ritual in the Midwest , where I live . <eou> That ' s an interesting ritual . I used to live near an orchard growing up . Brings back so many memories , but never went berry picking . I regret that now . <eou> It ' s never too late to start !

My mom used to read me fairy tales every night before bed . <eou> I always loved being told fairy tales , my favorites involved eleven , trolls and dragons . <eou> Oh yeah ! I loved a good story with a Prince and a Princess . <eou> Fairy tales were often used to describe a happy ending to the story or a fairy tale romance . <eou> Cool ! I love how magical I always thought they were as a child . <eou> The Brothers Grimm were some of the best story tellers of their time and are responsible for most stories we know today like cinderella , snowwhite and sleeping beauty <eou> I have heard of them before ! My favorite fairy tail was always Cinderella . <eou> There are actually many different versions of the cinderella story from different countries . <eou> I didn ' t know that but it makes sense that the story of the underdog getting the Prince . <eou> 	It was originally titled '' the glass slipper '' and it highlighted the themes of unjust oppression and reward !	mom night fairy bed tales read <eou> loved told fairy favorites tales <eou> story loved <eou> romance fairy happy story tale tales describe <eou> magical <eou> stories story tellers time <eou> tail fairy <eou>  <eou> sense makes story getting <eou>  <expand> unjust themes titled slipper highlighted originally glass reward <index> 959
What do you think about chicken ? <eou> I LOVE chicken . Especially crispy fried chicken ! <eou> Cool . I love to eat chicken as well . I had a pet chicken as a child though . <eou> So does that mean you don ' t eat chicken as a source of food then ? <eou> I do actually ! In fact , the reason I had the pet chicken was because when we moved into the farm house they had removed all the chicken that were there before we lived there . However , this one chicken had hidden behind the chicken coop door . The previous people made a deal with me over the course of a few months that they would give me a kitten if I gave them their chicken . I accepted because I didn ' t have much of a choice as a child and farm life is different than city life . Anyway , they said I had fattened it up well and it was the best chicken they ever ate . <eou> hahaha that is the most bizarre story I ' ve ever heard . I bet they made chicken and waffles <eou> lol ! I don ' t think they knew about chicken and waffles in that part of the world , but maybe ... :-RRB- <eou> What part of the world is that ?

I have a pet Pug named corky :-RRB- He ' s the cutest ! <eou> I love pugs , I like them for their fine , glossy coat , they come in a variety of colours , most often fawn or black , and they have a cute square body with lots of muscles . <eou> I love them too ! Mine is black . Where did the breed originate from ? <eou> If my memory serves me correctly , Pugs were actually brought from China to Europe in the 16th century and were very popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands , and the House of Stuart . <eou> Woah ! I didn ' t realize they had that much history ... Corky must have been royalty ! Haha . <eou> Indeed they were , I bet they were popular because Pugs are well known for being really sociable and gentle companion dogs and they are good around kids . <eou> Awww , my Corky does have a very gentle temperament .

If I could ever get over the fear I would go . <eou> It ' s too bad that they can ' t build a long bridge to get there for people like you . Maybe the fact that the island is volcanic makes that a good idea to not travel there . <eou> Yeah probably . I like experiencing new places . See things I ' ve never seen . As long as I can drive lol <eou> It ' s crazy that the first settlement on Iceland dates back to 874 . That ' s a long time ago ! I wonder what they ate back then . <eou> Yes that is a very long time ago . I imagine the things they ate back then were trial and error . Probably like , oh this looks good lets see if we can eat it without being poisoned . <eou> That ' s true . Being surrounded by water makes me think a lot of seafood .

Divorce seems to be running rampant these days . The bonds of matrimony seem less meaningful than ever before . <eou> I definitely agree . People jump into getting married , that ' s why .

She and I are both working professionals and the thought of the monetary and legal implications of divorce have me treading lightly . It ' s just that prenups aren ' t exactly romantic . <eou> Definitely ! I never understood a prenup . I always thought it showed lack of faith that things would work out . You would always have it looming over your head . <eou> Agreed . Although I ' ve always thought that a simple prenup with a binding arbitration agreement would be prudent . In other words : if we get divorced , we agree not to take it to court and to settle it between ourselves . <eou> 	Yes , I see no problem with that !
