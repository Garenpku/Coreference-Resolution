What do you think of our price ?  <eou>  Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?  <eou>  Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .  <eou>  I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .  <eou>  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .  <eou>  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .  <eou>  I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .  <eou>  Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?  <eou>  We've already cut down our price to cost level .  <eou>  Is that all ?  <eou>  Yes , this is the best we can do .  <eou> 	 I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered . 	price <eou> price <eou> prices regret products raw adjust price original <eou> price <eou> line offer price market <eou> business pay lower price <eou> price afraid reduction <eou> sales prices profit run <eou> cost price <eou>  <eou>  <eou>  <expand> handle price sorry offered
So , Jimmy , how does it feel to have your own money ?  <eou>  It ’ s great , dad .

Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?  <eou>  You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .  <eou>  But what if I need my money suddenly ?  <eou>  The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .  <eou>  Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !  <eou>  Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges .

Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview .  <eou>  It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time .  <eou>  You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview .  <eou>  The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation .  <eou>  Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation .  <eou>  To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression .  <eou>  Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief .  <eou>  It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn .  <eou>  You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for .  <eou>  While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately  <eou>  Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description .  <eou> 	 Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . 	saying pot attention pay properly own interview special selling yourself <eou> especially job time market <eou> interview prepare <eou> particular situation <eou> interviewer <eou> interviewer leave yourself <eou> yourself statement <eou> blow <eou> applying strong position related <eou>  <eou>  <eou>  <expand> corresponding contents apply prepared interview adjustments

The car's energy is what will keep us warm .  <eou>  I have plenty of gas .  <eou>  Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon .

I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks .  <eou>  Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .  <eou>  Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .  <eou>  Do you sell direct to shops ?  <eou>  Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .  <eou>  Do you keep a stock of these things ?  <eou>  In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .  <eou>  That is , your commission .  <eou>  Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .  <eou>  Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .  <eou>  The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .  <eou>  According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?  <eou>  We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .  <eou>  We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...  <eou>  Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?  <eou>  Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .  <eou>  Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .  <eou>  Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .  <eou>  Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?  <eou>  Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .  <eou>  All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .  <eou> 	 Very good .

Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ?  <eou>  Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation .

So I doubt its authority .  <eou>  More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy .

Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other .  <eou>  If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .  <eou>  Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .  <eou>  But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience .

Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?  <eou>  Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .  <eou>  You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .  <eou>  What's special about these things ?  <eou>  Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .  <eou> 	 Thanks .

Right , let me run through your options . You can go ahead and cash your undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate if you really want to , but I'd recommend a Personal Durable Commodities Loan .  <eou>  OK , what does that entail ?  <eou>  It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .  <eou>  Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?  <eou>  Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .  <eou>  I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?  <eou>  Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .  <eou> 	 Absolutely , Jenny .

The bathroom looks lovely . Did you redecorate it yourself or did you get someone in to do it for you ?  <eou>  I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ’ m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .  <eou>  So , let ’ s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ’ Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ’ t they ?  <eou>  Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .  <eou>  How long did it take you to do the tiling .  <eou>  As I hadn ’ t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .  <eou>  I think you ’ Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?  <eou> 	 You ’ ll be lucky !

I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles .  <eou>  We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .  <eou>  Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .  <eou>  I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .  <eou>  I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources .  <eou>  But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .  <eou>  I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .  <eou>  There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .  <eou> 	 Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . 	hear offer <eou> offer five ready <eou> sales push price <eou> deal little price markets offer hear <eou> price <eou> trade superior <eou> competition products synthetic <eou> price <eou>  <expand> try ll lot price suppose difficulties buy clients

I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement .  <eou>  Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now .  <eou>  Take your time .  <eou>  I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .  <eou>  I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .  <eou>  We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?  <eou>  Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .  <eou>  The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first .  <eou>  Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .  <eou>  When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .  <eou>  How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?  <eou>  To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .  <eou>  Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?  <eou>  I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet .

You're finally here ! What took so long ?  <eou>  I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .  <eou>  It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .  <eou>  I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .  <eou>  perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .  <eou>  I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .  <eou>  It would be better for the environment , too .  <eou>  I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .  <eou>  Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .  <eou>  The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .  <eou>  Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .  <eou>  That's true .

the air quality in this city is horrendous !

Hi , Bob , everything okay ?  <eou>  More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .  <eou>  Oh ? What's that ?  <eou>  Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree .

That's terrible .  <eou>  I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .  <eou>  Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .  <eou> 	 That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor .

Oh , my God ! I've been cheated !  <eou>  What ? What did you buy ?  <eou>  It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !  <eou>  What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?  <eou>  There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .  <eou>  And ?  <eou>  So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .  <eou>  And it's a brick ?  <eou>  Yes .  <eou>  I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?  <eou>  I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .  <eou>  So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .  <eou>  Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .  <eou>  But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?  <eou>  He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .  <eou>  Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !  <eou>  C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .  <eou>  That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .  <eou> 	 You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it .

Come in , Arnold . Have a seat .  <eou>  Good morning .  <eou>  Would you like something to drink ?  <eou>  No , thank you .

But I'm not really a smoker .  <eou>  Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?  <eou>  I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .  <eou>  I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .  <eou>  It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .  <eou>  Yes .  <eou>  Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .  <eou>  What do you suggest ?  <eou>  The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .  <eou>  You mean because people have to go across town to get here .  <eou>  Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .  <eou>  That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .  <eou>  I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .  <eou>  I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .  <eou>  Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .  <eou>  Well .  <eou>  I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .  <eou>  You mean you want to run the meetings ?  <eou>  No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .  <eou>  Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .  <eou>  I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .  <eou>  I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .  <eou>  Excellent .

Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by your work ?  <eou>  Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days .

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .  <eou>  We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .  <eou>  I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .  <eou>  We need to find a good realtor .  <eou>  Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .  <eou>  What do you mean ?  <eou>  Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .  <eou>  But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .  <eou>  Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .  <eou>  I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has  <eou>  Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .  <eou>  So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?  <eou>  It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .  <eou>  And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?  <eou>  Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .  <eou>  Why ?  <eou>  Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .  <eou>  Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .  <eou>  It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .  <eou>  I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .  <eou> 	 Alright .

So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ...  <eou>  We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...  <eou> 	 That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . 	plan set marketing goals tell talk looking begin move <eou> set line image goal <eou>  <expand> data slow market evaluate decent original overseas managed red rocket correct marketing represents condition hand looking describe start sales set previous final blue goals consider remember double distribution look third line markets figures overhead goal performance
